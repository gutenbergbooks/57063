<h2><em>PREFACE</em></h2>


<p>Most concert-goers have observed, at performances
of modern orchestral works of a
descriptive character, the efforts of many persons in
the audience to extract from programme notes and
analyses information as to the dramatic or pictorial
or poetic meaning of the music to which they were
listening. A search for enlightenment under such
conditions necessarily leads to disappointment,
since it is either pursued distractedly while the
music is actually in progress, or during the brief
and unpropitious leisure of an intermission. The
design of this book is to offer in compact and accessible
form such information as will enable the
intending concert-goer to prepare himself, in advance,
to listen comprehendingly to those symphonic
works of a suggestive or illustrative nature,
from Beethoven to the present day, which are
part of the standard orchestral repertoire, and
such others as seem likely to become so&mdash;to serve,
in effect, as a guide to modern orchestral programme-music.
For convenience of indication,
the designation "tone poems," as used in the sub-title,
is employed in its broadest significance to
characterize all modern delineative music for orchestra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
in the freer forms, whether it be a symphonic
poem by Liszt, a "legend" by d'Indy, a
suite by Charpentier, a "sketch" by Debussy, or
the precise thing described by Strauss as a <em>Tondichtung</em>.</p>

<p>No exclusively musical analysis of the works discussed
is attempted, since it is aimed merely to
give the concert-goer such information concerning
their illustrative purpose as will enable him to
place himself in an intelligent attitude towards
their performance. Nor has the author indulged
in speculative "interpretations" of any sort regarding
the poetic content of these works; he has confined
himself in every case to setting forth only
such facts and clews as have been ascertained or
justifiably inferred.</p>

<p>An exhaustive cataloguing of modern programme-music
has not been attempted. It has
been thought worth while to include only such
works of importance as the American concert-goer
is likely to find upon the programmes of symphony
concerts in this country. Thus such submerged
or moribund or otherwise negligible music as
Schumann's forgotten overture, "Julius Cæsar,"
Berlioz's overture to "Waverley," Rubinstein's
character-pictures, "Faust" and "Ivan IV.," Liszt's
"Hamlet," Beethoven's "King Stephen" and "Battle
of Vittoria," have been permitted to remain unexpounded.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span></p>

<p>A book such as this must necessarily be largely
of the nature of a compilation, since, in the case
of the older works in the concert-repertoire, it must
make use of information already obtained and
recorded. It is believed, however, that it may
supply a want hitherto unfulfilled in that, particularly,
it assembles in convenient shape information
concerning important contemporary works
which exists, at present, only in a scattered and
more or less unavailable condition.</p>

<p>In justification of its purpose, the author may
be permitted to say that he considers it absurd and
illogical that the concert-goer should, as some assert,
be asked to listen to a piece of descriptive
music in ignorance of its literary or pictorial or
dramatic basis. He heartily agrees with Mr. Ernest
Newman, who has written with unsurpassed acumen
and force concerning programme-music and
its principles, when he asserts that "if the poem
or the picture was necessary to the composer's
imagination, it is necessary to mine; if it is not
necessary to either of us, he has no right to affix
the title of it to his work; ... if melody, harmony,
and development are all shaped and directed by
certain pictures in the musician's mind, we get no
further than the mere outside of the music unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>we are familiar with those pictures." A title, it
is true, is sometimes sufficient as a spur to the
hearer's imagination&mdash;as in the case, for example,
of such broadly impressionistic music as Claude
Debussy's "The Sea," the various movements of
which bear these subsidiary titles: "From Dawn
till Noon on the Sea"; "Frolics of Waves"; "Dialogue
of the Wind and the Sea." But what would
the hearer, unacquainted with the subject which
provoked it, make of Debussy's "Prelude to 'The
Afternoon of a Faun,'" did not the appended sub-title&mdash;"Eclogue
of S. Mallarmé"&mdash;direct him to the
source of the composer's inspiration, the fantastic
and singular poem of the French symbolist? Even
in the case of descriptive music based upon an
exceedingly familiar subject, the title alone may
be insufficient. In the case, for instance, of Edward
MacDowell's symphonic poem, "Lancelot
and Elaine," the composer offers his listener merely
the title. He has said, indeed, that he "never
would have insisted that this symphonic poem
need mean 'Lancelot and Elaine' to every one."
Yet if he intended this music, as it is known that
he did, to describe certain definite and particular
incidents in the story of Lancelot and the Maid
of Astolat&mdash;as the tournament, Lancelot's downfall,
his interview with Guinevere, the passing of
the funeral barge&mdash;it obviously could not, without
a sacrifice of psychological and dramatic consistency,
coincide with any other sequence of happenings
which the uninstructed listener might choose to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
substitute. To tell the hearer that he is at liberty
to interpret a piece of avowed and detailed descriptive
music according to any "programme"
which may happen to occur to him, is, in principle,
precisely like playing for him on the piano a new
and unknown song, and telling him that he may
fit to it any words he chooses.</p>

<p>It cannot be too positively insisted upon that,
as Mr. Newman has pointedly observed, a piece
of eloquent delineative music cannot be equally
understood and appreciated by the man who
knows and the man who does not know its programme.
Mr. Newman concedes, of course, the
fact that such a work as Tschaikowsky's overture,
"Romeo and Juliet," would undoubtedly "give
intense pleasure to any one who listened to it as
a piece of music, pure and simple." "But I deny,"
he continues, "that this hearer would receive as
much pleasure from the work as I do. He might
think the passage for muted strings, for example,
extremely beautiful, but he would not get from it
such delight as I, who not only feel all the <em>musical</em>
loveliness of the melody and the harmonies and
the tone color, but see the lovers on the balcony
and breathe the very atmosphere of Shakespeare's
scene. I am richer than my fellow by two or three
emotions in a case of this kind. My nature is stirred
on two or three sides instead of only one. I would
go further and say that not only does the auditor
I have supposed get less pleasure from the work
than I, but he really does not hear Tschaikowsky's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
work at all. If the musician writes music to a
play and invents phrases to symbolize the characters
and to picture the events of the play, we
are simply not listening to <em>his</em> work at all if we
listen to it in the ignorance of his poetical scheme.
We may hear the music, but it is not the music
he meant us to hear"&mdash;which is simply a more telling
and vivid statement of a truth which Berlioz
enunciated more than three score and ten years
ago in a prefatory note to his <cite>Symphonie fantastique</cite>:
"The plan of an instrumental drama, being
without words, requires to be explained beforehand.
The programme (which is indispensable to
the perfect comprehension of the dramatic plan of
the work) ought therefore to be considered in the
light of the spoken text of an opera, serving to ...
indicate the character and expression."</p>

<p>It should be said, in conclusion, that these elucidations&mdash;if
they may hopefully be regarded as such&mdash;are
addressed, not to the professional student
of music, but to the intelligent concert-goer who
desires to listen understandingly, and with adequate
appreciation, to those works which are intended
not merely to appeal to his perception of
beautiful sound and beautiful form, but which
set before him, for the education of his heart or
the delight of his spirit, some notable and intense
impression of the human drama or the visible
world.</p>

<h2>THE ORCHESTRA AS POET, PAINTER, AND DRAMATIST</h2>

<p>"How can an orchestra, without the aid of voices
or pantomime or scenery, tell the story of
Don Quixote, paint a picture of the sea, or describe
the visions of a dying man?" asks an intelligent
but somewhat puzzled layman. "I have always
thought of instrumental music," he goes on to say,
"as the art of arranging tones according to more
or less binding laws of design and effect; and yet
I hear constant talk nowadays of the 'expressive
capacity' of music, its ability to paint pictures,
tell stories, enact dramas. What, briefly, is meant
by the 'expressive (or pictorial or descriptive)
capacity' of music?" Perhaps it may be possible
to tell him&mdash;"briefly," as he requests.</p>

<p>Music in the old days&mdash;the days before Beethoven,
let us say&mdash;was, outside of the church and the opera-house,
primarily an art of pure design. The musician
of those days was concerned mainly with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the arrangement of tones according to certain well-defined
rules and conventions, to the end of producing
a euphonious and beautiful pattern of sound.
The symphonies of Mozart, the early symphonies
of Beethoven, had no other aim than to be beautiful.
Music was then, as has been aptly said, a species of
"sensuous mathematics." The musician who, in
the year 1797, set out to compose a symphony, proceeded
according to very definite rules. He must
invent what was called a "first theme," usually
rather vigorous and assertive in character, and a
"second theme," of contrasting character&mdash;usually
of a gentler and more feminine quality. These
themes were then developed at length&mdash;presented
in different keys, altered as to rhythm, harmony,
and instrumentation, in whatever manner was made
possible by the composer's skill and the fertility
of his invention. Finally, the two themes were
recalled in their original state, and the first movement
of the symphony was at an end. The composer
had accomplished a complete musical organism
in what was called, among his craft, "sonata
form." He might then proceed with the other
movements of his symphony, which must also be
constructed according to certain specific laws.
Always he must proceed according to rule. His
"second theme," for example, must be sounded in
a key which bore a hard-and-fast relationship to
the key of his "first theme"; and if his symphony
began, let us say, in F major, it must end in F
major, or in some closely related key. It would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
never for a moment have occurred to him&mdash;this
excellent eighteenth-century music-maker&mdash;to begin
a serious composition in F major and end it,
say, in C-sharp minor: that would have seemed an
aberration of the most preposterous kind.</p>

<p>Our eighteenth-century instrumental composer,
then, was a builder of tonal edifices of a very plain
and solid kind, which must be proportioned and
fashioned strictly according to rule. Moreover, his
constructive material, so to speak, was of the
sparest. His range of harmony was extremely
small, his melodic patterns were simple in outline
and of limited expressiveness, his rhythms were
square-cut and obvious, his orchestral technique
of the most meagre order. There were, it is true,
composers prior to the nineteenth century who
wrote a crude kind of orchestral programme-music
<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;
music which aimed to describe scenes and
events, to picture aspects of nature and definite
states of mind. Karl von Dittersdorf (1739-1799)
composed a number of symphonies descriptive
of Ovid's "Metamorphoses"&mdash;"The Downfall of
Phaëton," "Acteon's Transformation into a Deer,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
"Andromeda's Rescue by Perseus," "Phineus with
his Friends in the Mountains." Justin Heinrich
Knecht (1752-1817) anticipated certain features
of the "Pastoral" symphony in his "Tableau musical
de la nature," composed when Beethoven was
fourteen years old; and Haydn gave to certain of
his multiple symphonies naively indicative titles&mdash;"The
Hunt," "The Morning," "Fire." But such
manifestations of the "programmatic" tendency
bore little relation to the really serious and important
musical art of the period. The symphonist
of Haydn's day little dreamed of a time when men
of his trade would erect tonal structures of strange
and fantastic shape, from materials whose rarity
and richness were beyond his conception; and that
within these gorgeous and curiously wrought structures,
dramas of human passion and emotion, comedies
and tragedies, would be enacted for other men
to see and to be moved thereby.</p>

<p>Yet that is what happened. As the years went
by musicians began to discern that the art in which
they were working contained singular and unsuspected
possibilities. They began, by laborious
and slow experiment, and by unconscious inspiration,
to evolve new harmonies, more subtle and
complex than the old, which thrilled them oddly;
their melodies took on a freer, more pliant, more
expressive character; their rhythms became more
varied and supple, their instrumentation richer,
fuller, more complex. Then it dawned upon them
that this art of theirs, which had been but a kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of inspired and innocent pattern-weaving, might
be made to express definite emotions, moods, experiences,
even many things in the material world,
without the aid of scenery, singers, or singing-actors.
They found that certain combinations and
sequences of tones could be made to convey to the
hearer certain more or less definite feelings and
ideas: that minor harmonies, in slow and grave
rhythms, suggested grief or depression; and that,
conversely, harmonies in the major mode, in rapid
and energetic movement, suggested gaiety, or
jubilation, or relief. And then, of course, there
were directly imitative effects which might be employed
to suggest an aspect of nature or to aid in
the telling of a story&mdash;the songs of birds, the
whistling of wind, the crash of thunder, the rhythmic
tramping of armies, the trumpets and drums
of martial conflict, the horn fanfares of the chase;
for all these things suggested easily and naturally
their analogies in tone.</p>

<p>But it soon became evident to the composer that
no matter how intense and vivid his music might be,
it could be made to express, unaided, only <em>general</em>
emotions, moods, passions. He could say&mdash;as does
Chopin, for example, in the funeral march in his
B-flat minor sonata&mdash;"I am sad"; but he could
not say <em>why</em> he was sad; he could not say, "I am
sad because my mother has died," or "because my
country has been vanquished." So, to supply this
need&mdash;to make it possible for his music to speak
both eloquently and concretely&mdash;the composer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
called in the aid of the written and associated word,
and the miracle was accomplished. Upon the score
of his symphony or his "tone-poem" he wrote,
for example, the title "Don Quixote"; this title
he made known to his audience; and the hearers,
with this clew, were thus made aware that they were
listening to an expression in tones&mdash;tones of a kind
unimagined by Haydn or Mozart, tones of marvellous
poignancy and vividness&mdash;of the dreams and longings
and passions and griefs of a particular person
whose story they intimately knew: the definite
emotions and events of a definite drama, rich in
comedy, pathos, tenderness, and human fascination.</p>

<p>This, then, is the miracle of modern "programme-music";
this is why we say of it that it is
capable of voicing comedy or tragedy, pathos or
ecstasy; this is why, in brief, we may speak of its
"expressive capacity."</p>

<p>The growth of the art in this direction has been
as steady as it has been amazing. Music, with
Haydn and Mozart (it is always to be remembered
that we are discussing here only <em>symphonic</em> music)
was, as has been said, largely a weaving of tonal
arabesques, innocent of meaning or definite expression.
The great Beethoven came, and transformed
its naïve tones into new and powerful sonorities,
developing, expanding, discovering, until he had
endowed it with a novel and unfamiliar eloquence.
Schubert followed him, adding new effects of harmony,
new and unparalleled ways of grouping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
tones, and filling the art with a fresh and wonderful
exuberance, making it sing with a new tenderness
and ecstasy. He left it a richer, a more
amply expressive medium than he had found it.
Came Berlioz, a master of orchestral utterance,
of orchestral delineation. He made of music the
handmaid of romance and passion as he found them
in the world's dramas and poems and novels.
Franz Liszt, a man of fervid imagination and intrepid
individuality, added still other notes to
the instrument&mdash;enlarged its compass, increased its
sonority. Under him the symphony renounced its
strict allegiance to the classic forms and became
frankly a medium of dramatic and poetic expression.
He made a thing which he called a "symphonic
poem," in which the music was conceived and
evolved, not in accordance with those classic rules
of form of which we have spoken, but in accordance
with the outlines of a chosen poem or a drama; so
that he was able to illustrate in music, with the aid
of title or descriptive text, the story of Hamlet or
the Divine Comedy or Orpheus or Tasso or Prometheus.
Wagner, though his field was not the
concert-room, but the opera-house, so enlarged the
possibilities of tonal speech as to make of it virtually
a new language. His genius yielded, with magical
fertility, a bewildering wealth of novel harmonic,
melodic, and orchestral ideas&mdash;ideas which have
been appropriated to the music of the concert-hall
by all those who have followed him.</p>

<p>And so we come to the music of our own time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
which is but a logical and inevitable result of a
century of growth and evolution. What, above
all, is characteristic of it? First, its devotion to
a "programme"&mdash;to a literary or dramatic or
pictorial subject. Our modern tone-poet&mdash;as we
aptly call him&mdash;having found ready to his hand
an art which can convey with extraordinary vividness
moods of longing and despair, ecstasy and
jubilation, must make it still more specific and
articulate. He writes a huge orchestral work and
calls it, let us say, "Death and Transfiguration,"
presenting with it an elaborate poem descriptive of
the agonies and hallucinations, the memories and
visions, of a dying man. He then invites us to find
in his music a description, which he produces by
means of every harmonic, melodic, rhythmic, and
orchestral device at his command, of the subject
which he has set before us. To achieve his end&mdash;to
express all those varied emotions of anguish,
terror, longing, despair, aspiration, triumph&mdash;he
stops at nothing: he heaps dissonance upon dissonance,
he writes in several keys at once, he assaults
our ears with what would have seemed to the placid
soul of Haydn the pandemonium of a mad-house.
Yet, if he be a genius, we are swayed and enthralled.
We even derive a double pleasure from this new
kind of art-work, which is at once music and drama.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, is the method of the modern "tone-poet."
He is, as has been said, both musician and
dramatist, symphonist and poet. Nor is this all:
he can be a painter as well, and can, by the aid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of suggestion and the broad analogies of his tonal
palette, limn for us with his instruments such an
exquisite and magical picture of the dawn as
Charles Martin Loeffler paints in his orchestral
fantasy after Verlaine, "La Bonne Chanson"; or
such a portrait as is limned by Strauss, in his
"Don Quixote," of the crack-brained and lovable
knight of Cervantes. Music, to-day, can annotate
the art of the painter&mdash;as witness the symphonic
commentary by the Swiss composer, Hans Huber,
on certain paintings by Böcklin; it can be sportively
delineative of personalities&mdash;as witness Sir Edward
Elgar's orchestral characterization of the peculiarities
of various of his friends; it can be portentously
metaphysical, as in Strauss's formidable
"Also Sprach Zarathustra": it has become, in
brief, "a tongue of all life."</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">TONE-POEM, "THE WITCH OF ATLAS"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h3>

<p>This tone-poem is noteworthy, aside from its
intrinsic quality, for the completeness with
which it fulfils the obligations imposed by logic
and consistency upon the writer of programme-music.
Here is an orchestral work inspired by
certain portions of Shelley's poem&mdash;a musical illustration
of various passages which in themselves
contain the imaginative essence of that extraordinary
fantasy. But the composer has not been
content merely to tell us that his music is a tone-poem
"after Shelley"; he has gone further: he has
quoted as a preface to the score the precise passages
in the poem which suggested his music; and
opposite each passage he has placed a key-letter,
which refers to a duplicate printed at the beginning
of the corresponding illustrative passage in the
music. That is to say, he has enabled us to follow
him throughout the entire course of his musical
exposition, not dubiously and by guesswork, but
with certitude and intelligent comprehension. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
are not put to it to decide whether, for example,
the mellifluous <em>andante</em> passage for four horns, in
the middle section of the work, is intended as an
illustration of the lines in the poem descriptive of
the "green and over-arching bower" inhabited by
those who had received the Witch's panacea, or of
the lines which celebrate the radiance of her beauty:
we know precisely what it is intended to represent,
and are in a position not only to feel its effect as
sheer music, but to appreciate its expressive force.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Prefaced to the score are these excerpts from Shelley's

<h3 class="nobreak">PRELUDE, "SAPPHO"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h3>

<p>This is an orchestral preface to nine fragments
from Sappho set to music for contralto and orchestra,
and "indicating," says the composer,
"emotional moods of the Greek poetess as an introduction
to her songs." The verses set to music
by Mr. Bantock are (1) the famous Hymn to Aphrodite,
and the fragments beginning as follows: (2)
"I loved thee once, Atthis, long ago";<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (3) "Evening,
thou bringest all"; (4) "Stand face to face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
friend"; (5) "The moon has set"; (6) "Peer of
Gods he seems"; (7) "In a dream I spake"; (8)
Bridal Song&mdash;"O fair, O lovely!" (9) "Muse of the
golden throne."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The Prelude is constructed of themes taken from
certain of the songs to which it serves as an introduction.
It opens with harp-chords, in the manner of
an improvisation, derived from the setting of the ninth
Fragment:</p>

<p class= "indent small2">
"Muse of the golden throne,<br />
O raise thy strain...."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>This is repeated; then follows, after some intervening
measures, an expressive phrase sung by violins,
'cellos, horn, and bassoon, which, in the setting of
the fifth Fragment, accompanies the words:</p>

<p class= "indent small2">
"I yearn and seek, I know not what to do,<br />
And I flutter like a child after her mother."</p>

<p>There is a crescendo, leading to a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fortissimo</i> proclamation
by the trumpet of a theme from the ninth
Fragment ("Muse of the Golden Throne"), followed
by the impassioned theme (for violins and
trumpet) which, towards the close of the fifth
Fragment, underscores the lines:</p>

<p class= "indent small2">
"Yea, Eros shakes my soul, yea, Eros,<br />
A wind on the mountain falling on the oaks."</p>

<p>This leads directly into a climactic outburst for
full orchestra, on a theme borrowed from the sixth
Fragment:</p>

<p class= "indent small2">
"Dare I to love thee?"</p>

<p>A languishing passage follows (strings, wood-wind,
and horns), taken from the setting of the words
(in the sixth Fragment):</p>

<p class= "indent small2">
"Sight have I none, nor hearing, cold dew bathes me,<br />
Paler than grass I am, and in my madness<br />
Seem as one dead."</p>

<p>There is a brief crescendo, then the conclusion, of
gradually subsiding intensity. The music is almost
note for note that of the seventh Fragment:</p>

<p class= "indent small2">
"Delicate Adonis is dying; what shall we do?<br />
Beat your breasts, maidens, and rend your tunics!<br />
Ah, for Adonis!<br />
The Dawn shall see thee no more,<br />
Nor dark-eyed Sleep, the daughter of Night,<br />
Ah, for Adonis!"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>

She was called 'The Poetess,' as Homer was called
'The Poet.' Aristotle quoted without question a judgment
that placed her in the same rank as Homer and Archilochus.
Plato, in the <cite>Phædrus</cite>, mentioned her as the tenth Muse.
Solon, hearing one of her poems, prayed that he might not
see death till he had learned it. Strabo speaks of her genius
with religious awe.... The epigrammists call her Child of
Aphrodite and Eros, nursling of the Graces, pride of Hellas,
peer of Muses, companion of Apollo. Nowhere is a hint whispered
that her poetry was aught but perfect. As far as we
can judge, these praises were strictly just. Of all the poets
of the world, of all the illustrious artists of all literatures,
Sappho is the one whose every word has a peculiar and unmistakable

"Sinfonia grande<br />
Napoleon Bonaparte...."</p>

<p>and thereby hang many tales.</p>

<p>Anton Schindler,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the close friend and biographer
of Beethoven, wrote at length in his famous Life
of the symphonist concerning the origin of the
<cite>Eroica</cite>. In the autumn of 1802, says Schindler,
Beethoven resumed a plan which he had formed
of doing homage to Napoleon, the hero of the day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
"in a grand instrumental work," and set about its
execution. "But it was not till the following year
that he applied himself in good earnest to that
gigantic composition, known by the title of <cite>Sinfonia
Eroica</cite>, which, however, in consequence of
various interruptions, was not finished till 1804....
The original idea of that symphony is said to
have been suggested by General Bernadotte, who
was then French ambassador at Vienna, and had
a high esteem for our Beethoven....</p>

<p>"In his political sentiments Beethoven was a
republican; the spirit of independence natural to
a genuine artist gave him a decided bias that way.
Plato's <cite>Republic</cite> was transfused into his flesh and
blood, and upon the principles of that philosopher
he reviewed all the constitutions in the world. He
wished all institutions to be modelled upon the plan
prescribed by Plato. He lived in the firm belief
that Napoleon entertained no other design than to
republicanize France upon similar principles, and
thus, as he conceived, a beginning would be made
for the general happiness of the world. Hence his
respect and enthusiasm for Napoleon.</p>

<p>"A fair copy of the musical work for the First
Consul of the French Republic, the conqueror of
Marengo, with the dedication to him, was on the
point of being despatched through the French embassy
to Paris, when the news arrived in Vienna
that Napoleon Bonaparte had caused himself to
be proclaimed Emperor of the French. The first
thing Beethoven did on receiving this intelligence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
was to tear the title-leaf off the symphony (on it
were written the words 'Napoleon Bonaparte') and
then fling the work itself, with a torrent of execrations
against the French Emperor&mdash;against the new
'tyrant'&mdash;upon the floor, from which he would not
allow it to be lifted.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>"It was a long time before Beethoven recovered
from the shock, and permitted this work to be
given to the world.... I shall only add that it
was not till the tragic end of the great Emperor at
St. Helena that Beethoven was reconciled with him
and remarked that, seventeen years before, he had
composed appropriate music to the catastrophe, in
which it was exactly predicted musically, but unwittingly&mdash;alluding
to the Dead March in the symphony."</p>

<p>When the symphony was first performed in public
under Beethoven's direction, at the Theater
an der Wien, April 7, 1805, it was announced on
the programme as "A new grand Symphony in
D-sharp by Herr Ludwig van Beethoven, dedicated
to his excellence Prince von Lobkowitz." In
October of the following year the symphony was
published with this title and motto:</p>

<p class="center3"><em>Sinfonia Eroica.... Composta per festeggiare
il Sovvenire di un grand Uomo</em></p>

<p class="center">("Heroic Symphony.... Composed to celebrate
the memory of a great man.")</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Interpreters innumerable have attempted to read
the meaning of this baffling symphony, with its
funeral march followed perplexingly by a gay
scherzo and an energetic and jubilant finale. For
Adolph Marx (1799-1866) the dirge pictured a
battle-field at night, covered with the silent bodies
of the dead; the scherzo told of the rejoicings of
the homeward-bound soldiers; in the finale was
the consecration of victory by Peace. Berlioz
found the scherzo and finale akin to the rites celebrated
by Homer's warriors over a dead hero.
Still another elucidation, in which the license of
the interpreter is more than a little stretched,
found the first movement to convey "a grand idea
of Napoleon's determination of character." The
second movement is "descriptive of the funeral
honors paid to one of his favorite generals," the
"winding up" of which represents "the faltering
steps of the last gazers into the grave"; while the
finale offers "a combination of French revolutionary
airs"! But no one has viewed this symphony
more sympathetically or more consistently than
did Wagner in an article contributed to a series of
papers "On the poetic contents of Beethoven's
tone-works," published in the <cite>Neue Zeitschrift für
Musik</cite>, in 1852.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The designation 'heroic,'" he wrote, "is to be
taken in its widest sense, and in no wise to be conceived
as relating merely to a military hero. If
we broadly connote by 'hero' ('<em>Held</em>') the whole,
the full-fledged <em>man</em>, in whom are present all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
purely human feelings&mdash;of love, of grief, of force&mdash;in
their highest fill and strength, then we shall
rightly grasp the subject which the artist lets appeal
to us in the speaking accents of his tone-work.
The artistic space of this work is filled with all the
varied, inter crossing feelings of a strong, a consummate
individuality, to which nothing human
is a stranger, but which includes within itself all
truly human, and utters it in such a fashion that,
after frankly manifesting every noble passion, it
reaches a final rounding of its nature, wherein the
most feeling softness is wedded with the most energetic
force. The heroic tendency of this art work
is the progress towards that rounding off."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For him the first movement "embraces, as in a
glowing furnace, all the emotions of a richly gifted
nature in the heyday of unresting youth ... yet
all these feelings spring from one main faculty&mdash;and
that is <em>Force</em> ... we see a Titan wrestling with
the Gods."</p>

<p>In the second movement&mdash;the Funeral March&mdash;"this
shattering force" reaches the "tragic crisis"
towards which it was rushing. The tone-poet
clothes its proclamation in the musical apparel of
a Funeral march. Emotion tamed by deep grief,
moving in solemn sorrow, tells us its tale in stirring
tones.</p>

<p>"Force robbed of its destructive arrogance&mdash;by
the chastening of its deep sorrow&mdash;the Third Movement
shows in all its buoyant gaiety. Its wild unruliness
has shaped itself to fresh, to blithe activity;
we have before us now this lovable, glad man,
who paces hale and hearty through the fields of
Nature."</p>

<p>The finale shows us the man entire [that is to
say, as Wagner somewhat ponderously explains,
a combination of the two sides hitherto shown&mdash;the
"deeply, stoutly suffering man," and the "gladly,
blithely doing man"] harmoniously "at one with
self, in these emotions where the memory of Sorrow
becomes itself the shaping force of noble deeds.... The
whole, the total Man now shouts to us the
avowal of his Godhood."</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">OVERTURE TO "CORIOLANUS": Op. 62</h3>

<p>This overture, composed in 1807, was published
in the following year. The original manuscript is
inscribed: "<cite>Overtura (Zum Trauerspiel Coriolan),
composta da L. v. Beethoven</cite>." The "tragedy"
here indicated for which it was written is not the
"Coriolanus" of Shakespeare, but the "Coriolan"
of Heinrich Joseph von Collin, a contemporary of
Beethoven, who filled the post of Secretary at the
Austrian Court. In their main outlines, the plays
of Collin and of Shakespeare are alike, with, however,
this prime difference&mdash;the Coriolanus of Shakespeare
is slain, while the death of Collin's hero is
self-inflicted. According to Wagner, this overture
is a tone-picture of the scene&mdash;"the most decisive
of all"&mdash;between Coriolanus, his mother, and
wife, in the enemy's camp before the gates of his
native city. But the most pointed and illuminating
guide to the contents of Beethoven's music will
be found in these brief sentences written in elucidation
of the overture by Mr. H. E. Krehbiel: "One
may forget both plays [Collin's and Shakespeare's]
while listening to Beethoven, and go back to Plutarch
and the Greek tragic poets for the elements
of the music. They are the monumental ones illustrated
in the 'Prometheus' of Æschylus and
the '&#338;dipus' of Sophocles. Like Prometheus,
&#338;dipus, Ajax, and Pentheus, Coriolanus becomes
insolent in his pride and goes to destruction. He
is noble, kind, good, courageous, but vainglorious
in his pride of ancestry, position, and achievement;
and he falls. The elements in his character to
which Beethoven has given marvellously eloquent
proclamation are his pride, which leads him to refuse
to truckle to the plebeian tribunes; his rage
which had stomach for the destruction of Rome,
and his tenderness which makes him yield to the
tears of mother and wife and brings death to him.
The moods are two; the first is published in the
stupendous <em>unisono</em> C of the introduction and the
angry principal subject; the second, in the gentle
and melodious second theme. The overture dies
with mutterings in the depths; with pride unbroken."</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SYMPHONY No. 6, "PASTORAL": Op. 68</h3>

<p>The "Pastoral" symphony, composed in the
summer of 1808, is the first example of symphonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
programme-music by a great master. Its illustrative
purpose is frankly proclaimed by the descriptive
titles which head the separate movements
as follows:</p>


<p class="indentm small3">1. AWAKENING OF JOYFUL IMPRESSIONS ON ARRIVING
 IN THE COUNTRY</p>
<p class="center">(<em>Allegro ma non troppo</em>)</p>

<p class="indentm small3">2. SCENE BY THE BROOK</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Andante molto moto</em>)</p>

<p class="indentm small3">3. MERRY GATHERING OF COUNTRY-FOLK</p>
<p class="center">(<em>Allegro</em>)</p>

<p class="indentm small3">4. THUNDER-STORM</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Allegro</em>)</p>

<p class="indentm small3">5. SHEPHERD'S SONG; GLAD AND THANKFUL FEELINGS AFTER THE STORM</p>

<p class="spaceb center">(<em>Allegretto</em>)</p>

<p>Beethoven in the music of this symphony is
avowedly a musical realist. In the "Scene by the
Brook" he delineates the rippling of the water
by weaving and shimmering of the strings; the
songs of birds by imitative figures in the wood-wind
(the nightingale: flute; the quail: oboe; the
cuckoo: 2 clarinets), which he is at pains to label
in the score; and in the "Thunder-storm" section,
wind, falling rain, flashes of lightning, the growling
of thunder, are suggested by means of easily recognized
musical symbols. Yet that the composer
was here a somewhat timorous "programmist" is
indicated by the note which he wrote in the sketchbook
containing ideas for the music of the "Pastoral":
"The hearer is left to find out the situations
for himself"&mdash;a recommendation which he afterwards
thought better of&mdash;and by the deprecatory
after-thought with which he accompanied the description
of the symphony on the programme of the
concert at which it was first performed (in Vienna,
December 22, 1808): "More expression of feeling
than painting [depiction]"&mdash;and this despite the
verisimilitude of the storm and the phonographic
warblings of the instrumental birds in a tone-poem
whose naïve realism is as deliberate as it is beyond
dispute!<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">OVERTURE TO "EGMONT": Op. 84</h3>

<p>Beethoven's incidental music to Goethe's "Egmont"
was commissioned by Hartl, manager of
the court theatres at Vienna. The overture, composed
in 1810, was performed for the first time,
together with the rest of the incidental music, at a
performance of the play at the Hofburg Theatre,
on May 24, 1810. The overture was published in
the following year.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>The dramatic significance of this music has been
pithily summarized by Mr. Philip Hale: "The overture
is at first a mighty lamentation. There are
the voices of an aroused and angry people, and
there is at the last tumultuous rejoicing."</p>

<p>The more elaborate interpretation of Dr. Leopold
Damrosch is as acceptable as any:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The overture begins with an outcry&mdash;a cry for
help&mdash;uttered by an entire nation. Then follow
heavy, determined chords, which seem to press
down the very life of the people, who seem helplessly
... to yield to their fate. Only the all-pervading
woe remains impressively sounded forth,
first by the oboe.... From every side the wail is repeated,
... bringing before us, as in a picture, the
hands of the nation uplifted in prayer to Heaven,
until it is lost in the unison of the first outcry,
fortissimo.... Only one ray of hope remains&mdash;Egmont.
But even his light-hearted nature seems
imbued with anxiety for his oppressed country.
His motive is as if bound in chains by the simultaneous
repetition of sombre chords. In deep melancholy
the violins repeat the motive, seeming
to languish more and more. But with sudden
impulse it revives; Egmont shakes off the gloom
which surrounds him; his pulse beats quickly and
gladly. On every side his fellow-citizens cry to
him for aid. They flock together, and in excited
bands surround him, their only champion and
deliverer. As if to arouse Egmont still more to
action, the sombre chords of the introduction are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
heard suddenly, but now in agitated measures,
shorter, more commanding, and more incisive.
Egmont heeds not these warnings. His short,
lightly given answers indicate that the decisive
moment has not yet arrived for him. Three times
the stringed instruments thunder forth the word of
command. Then, as if Egmont with a prophetic
eye saw the future before him, he seems to press
forward with a mighty rush to meet the oppressors.
The hosts of followers, faithful to his call, rally to a
spirited attack, and in fierce contest the victory
seems to be won.</p>

<p>"But this is only a dream. True to his nature,
he is playing with his doom. Two vehemently interrupting
chords try to arouse Egmont from his
reveries; but still he dreams on and hears them not.
Beethoven then leads to the dramatic catastrophe
and to the musical climax. Harshly and powerfully
the authoritative chords resound again....
This time they arouse Egmont from his reveries; and
for the first time he seems to have a presentiment of
the actual danger. But his vision of before has not
yet left him. It still hovers about him, and even
the repeated alarm will not shake it from his mind.</p>

<p>"For the third time the terrible chords resound
with trumpets and kettle-drums thundering out
from the orchestra fortissimo. At last the illusion
is over. A cry of anguish escapes him. His fate
is sealed. Death is his doom. In mute horror the
people surround the scaffold of their idol and their
heart-felt prayers ascend to Heaven.</p>

<p>"But now their wrath, gaining double force from
the martyrdom of their hero and from the hope that
Heaven will listen to their prayers, bursts forth.
At first a distant murmur is heard. But in wild
turmoil the storm of insurrection swells onward;
and soon triumphal sounds of victory announce the
tyrant's downfall. We hear the chains resolutely
rent asunder, and louder rises the cry of victory."</p>

<h2>BERLIOZ</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Hector Berlioz: born in la Côte Saint-André, France, December
11, 1803; died in Paris, March 9, 1869</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">OVERTURE TO "KING LEAR": Op. 4</h3>

<p>Berlioz, a sincere and ardent admirer of the
genius of Shakespeare, wrote his overture to
"King Lear" at Nice and at Rome in the spring
of 1831. Although the work bears an early opus
number, it stands, in order of composition, between
the <em>Symphonie fantastique</em> (Op. 14-a, 1830) and
<cite>Lélio</cite> (Op. 14-b, 1831-1832).</p>

<p>Berlioz had seen his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">innamorata</i>, Henrietta Smithson,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
play Shakespearian rôles at the <cite>Odéon</cite>, Paris,
in 1827. He was profoundly impressed. "Shakespeare,"
he wrote afterwards, with characteristic
fervor, "coming upon me thus suddenly, struck
me as with a thunderbolt. His lightning opened
the heaven of art to me with a sublime crash, and
lighted up its fullest depths. I recognized true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
dramatic grandeur, beauty, and truth." Four
years later he wrote the "King Lear" overture.</p>

<p>Berlioz has supplied no programme or elucidation
of the music. It is entitled simply, <cite>Ouverture du
Roi Léar (Tragédie de Shakespeare)</cite>, leaving the
hearer to decipher unaided its precise significance.
Is it a character study of the figure of the harassed
and desperate king? Are definite incidents, definite
phases, of the tragedy, depicted in the music?
Or is the overture a preparatory mood-picture,
an introduction designed to awaken in the hearer
emotions appropriate to the play? Mr. Edward
Dannreuther, writing, with presumable deliberation,
in the "Oxford History of Music," declares that
"in this piece the form of expression ... is vivid
enough for a tragic opera which might be named
'Lear, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia'; so vivid, indeed,
that, given the general designation, even an unimaginative
hearer is likely to take the composer's meaning,
and to find the proper names for the themes."</p>

<p>What, in brief, are the general emotional characteristics
of the music? The opening is threatening,
portentous, fate-burdened.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> There are brief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
moments of tenderness&mdash;a pathetic tenderness. The
mood changes suddenly&mdash;the expression-mark in
the score is <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">disperato ed agitato</i>. The music is now
furious, turbulent, wildly passionate, interrupted by
intervals of quietness, of suspended intensity&mdash;a
quietness that is piteous, poignant, momentous.
The end is convulsive, storm-swept; and one is here
reminded of Hazlitt's description of the mind of
Lear, "staggering between the weight of attachment
and the hurried movements of passion, like
a tall ship driven about by the winds, buffeted
by the furious waves; ... or it is like the sharp
rock circled by the eddying whirlpool that foams
and beats against it, or like the solid promontory
pushed from its basis by the force of an earthquake."</p>

<p>It is possible to see in this music a picture of
Lear, "stretched to the last moment upon the rack
of this tough world"; of Cordelia, "unmingled tenderness
and strength, sunshine and rain at once";
of Goneril and Regan, types of "the ravening egoism
in humanity which is at war with all goodness."
Or one may recall the words of Coleridge
as most pithily characterizing the overture of Berlioz:
"What is <cite>Lear</cite>? It is storm and tempest&mdash;the
thunder at first grumbling in the far horizon,
then gathering around us, and at length bursting
in fury over our heads&mdash;succeeded by a breaking
of the clouds for a while, a last flash of lightning,
the closing in of night, and the single hope of
darkness."</p>

<p>This <cite>Symphonie fantastique</cite>, in five movements,
constitutes the first part of a work entitled by
Berlioz "Episode in the Life of an Artist." The
second part, a "lyric monodrama," is entitled
"Lélio; or, The Return to Life." The <cite>Symphonie
fantastique</cite> was composed in 1830, at the time of
Berlioz's "interminable and inextinguishable" passion
for the Irish actress Henrietta Smithson&mdash;the
tragic history of which this is not the place to
review. The "Episode in the Life of an Artist,"
as he wrote to his dear friend Ferrand early in 1830,
was to portray "the development of my infernal
passion." As to the meaning of the "Fantastic
Symphony," Berlioz has himself supplied the following
detailed explanatory preface:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>
<p>"A young musician of morbid sensibility and ardent
imagination poisons himself with opium in a fit of amorous
despair. The narcotic dose, too weak to result in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>death, plunges him into a heavy sleep accompanied by the
strangest visions, during which his sensations, sentiments,
and recollections are translated in his sick brain into
musical thought and images. The beloved woman herself
has become for him a melody, like a fixed idea which he
finds and hears everywhere.</p>

<p>"He first recalls that uneasiness of soul, that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vague

inspired him, his moments of delicious anguish, of jealous
fury, his returns to loving tenderness, and his religious
consolations.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">"Part II</span></p>

<p class="center small3">"SCENE IN THE FIELDS</p>

<p>"One summer evening in the country he hears two
shepherds playing a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ranz-des-vaches</i> in alternate dialogue;
this pastoral duet, the scene around him, the light rustling
of the trees gently swayed by the breeze, some hopes he
has recently conceived, all combine to restore an unwonted
calm to his heart and to impart a more cheerful
coloring to his thoughts; but <em>she</em> appears once more, his
heart stops beating, he is agitated with painful presentiments;
if she were to betray him!... One of the shepherds
resumes his artless melody, the other no longer answers
him. The sun sets ... the sound of distant thunder ...
solitude ... silence....</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">"Part IV</span></p>
<p class="center small3">"MARCH TO THE SCAFFOLD</p>

<p>"He dreams that he has killed his beloved, that he is
condemned to death and led to execution. The procession
advances to the tones of a march which is now sombre
and wild, now brilliant and solemn, in which the dull sound
of the tread of heavy feet follows without transition upon
the most resounding outbursts. At the end, the <em>fixed idea</em>
reappears for an instant, like a last love-thought interrupted
by the fatal stroke.</p>

He hears strange noises, groans, ringing laughter, shrieks,
to which other shrieks seem to reply. The <em>beloved melody</em>
again reappears; but it has lost its noble and timid character;
it has become an ignoble, trivial, and grotesque dance-tune:
it is <em>she</em> who comes to the witches' Sabbath....

<p>Upon the romanticists in France&mdash;"the heroic
boys of 1830," as William Ernest Henley called
them&mdash;the influence of Byron was gripping and
profound. To Berlioz, in particular, "greedy of
emotion, intolerant of restraint, contemptuous of
reticence and sobriety, ... and prepared to welcome,
as a return to truth and nature, inventions
the most extravagant and imaginings the most
fantastic and far-fetched," this prince of romanticists
must have seemed a poet after his own
heart. Yet, singularly enough, there are in his
writings comparatively few references to the author
of "Manfred" and "Don Juan."</p>

<p>The manner in which the "Harold" symphony
came to be written is related by Berlioz in his Memoirs.
His <cite>Symphonie fantastique</cite> had been played
at a concert at the Paris Conservatory (December
22, 1833), with conspicuous success. "And then,"
says Berlioz, "to crown my happiness, after the
audience had gone out, a man with a long mane of
hair, with piercing eyes, with a strange and haggard
face, one possessed by genius, a colossus among
giants, whom I had never seen and whose appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
moved me profoundly, was alone and waiting
for me in the hall, stopped me to press my hand,
overwhelmed me with burning praise, which set
fire to my heart and head: <em>it was Paganini!</em>...
Some weeks after this vindicatory concert of which
I have spoken, Paganini came to see me. 'I have
a marvellous viola,' he said, 'an admirable Stradivarius,
and I wish to play it in public. But I have
no music <em>ad hoc</em>. Will you write a solo piece for
the viola? You are the only one I can trust for
such a work.' 'Yes, indeed,' I answered, 'your
proposition flatters me more than I can tell, but, to
make such a virtuoso as you shine in a piece of this
nature, it is necessary to play the viola, and I do
not play it. You are the only one, it seems to me,
who can solve the problem.' 'No, no; I insist,'
said Paganini; 'you will succeed; as for me, I am
too sick at present to compose; I cannot think of it.'</p>

<p>"I tried then to please the illustrious virtuoso
by writing a solo piece for the viola, but a solo combined
with the orchestra in such a manner that it
would not injure the expression of the orchestral
mass, for I was sure that Paganini, by his incomparable
artistry, would know how to make the viola
always the dominating instrument....</p>

<p>"His proposal seemed new to me, and I soon had
developed in my head a very happy idea, and I was
eager for the realization. The first movement was
hardly completed, when Paganini wished to see it.
He looked at the rests for the viola in the allegro
and exclaimed: 'No, it is not that: there are too
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
many rests for me; I must be playing all the time.'
'I told you so,' I answered; 'you want a viola
concerto, and you are the only one who can write
such a concerto for yourself.' Paganini did not
answer; he seemed disappointed, and left me without
speaking further about my orchestral sketch.
Some days afterwards, suffering already from the
affection of the larynx which ultimately killed him,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
he went to Nice, and returned to Paris only at the
end of three years.</p>

<p>"Since I then saw that my plan of composition
would not suit him, I set myself to work in another
way, and without any anxiety concerning the
means to make the solo viola conspicuous. My
idea was to write for the orchestra a series of scenes
in which the solo viola should figure as a more or
less active personage of constantly preserved individuality;
I wished to put the viola in the midst
of poetic recollections left me by my wanderings in
the Abruzzi, and make it a sort of melancholy
dreamer, after the manner of Byron's 'Childe
Harold.' Hence the title, <cite>Harold en Italie</cite>. As in
the <cite>Symphonie fantastique</cite>, a chief theme (the first
song of the viola) reappears throughout the work;
but there is this difference: the theme of the
<cite>Symphonie fantastique</cite>, the 'fixed idea,' interposes
itself persistently as an episodic and passionate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
thought in the midst of scenes which are foreign to
it and modifies them; while the song of Harold is
added to other songs of the orchestra with which
it is contrasted both in movement and character
and without any interruption of the development."</p>

<p>The relationship between Berlioz's symphony
and Byron's poetic account of the Italian wanderings
of his Harold is of the slightest, and any
attempt to discover, in Berlioz's programme of the
moods and incidents of his symphonic hero, definite
correspondences with Byron's poem, would be
more than futile. One who seeks enlightenment
concerning the intentions of Berlioz in this symphony
must fall back upon the composer's own
brief hints as contained in the inscriptions appended
to the several movements. The voice of the solo
viola, as we know, typifies throughout the "melancholy
dreamer" as conceived by Berlioz&mdash;it is
Harold undergoing his adventures: in the mountains;
encountering a band of devout and simple
pilgrims; observing an enamoured mountaineer in
the act of serenading his mistress; and, finally,
involved in a tumultuous orgy of drunken bandits.
Concerning this last movement, Berlioz has left
us some additional information. Included in his
Memoirs is a letter addressed to Heine, in which
Berlioz gives an account of a performance of the
symphony at Brunswick in March, 1843. "In the
finale of 'Harold,'" he writes, "in this furious
orgy in which the drunkenness of wine, blood, joy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and rage all shout together; where the rhythm now
seems to stumble, and now to run madly; where the
mouths of brass seem to vomit forth curses and
reply with blasphemies to entreating voices; where
they laugh, drink, strike, bruise, kill, and ravish;
where, in a word, they amuse themselves; in this
scene of brigands the orchestra became a veritable
pandemonium; there was something supernatural
and frightful in the frenzy of its dash; everything
sang, leaped, roared with diabolical order and unanimity&mdash;violins,
basses, trombones, drums, and cymbals;
while the solo alto, Harold, the dreamer,
fleeing in fright, still sounded from afar some
trembling notes of his evening hymn. Ah! what
a feeling at the heart! What savage tremors in
conducting this astonishing orchestra! You know
nothing like it, the rest of you, poets; you have
never been swept away by such hurricanes of life.
I could have embraced the whole orchestra, but I
could only cry out, in French it is true, but my
accents surely made me understood: 'Sublime!
I thank you, gentlemen, and I wonder at you: you
are perfect brigands!'"</p>

</div>

<p>Bizet was commissioned to write incidental
music for the performance at the <cite>Vaudeville
Theatre</cite>, Paris, of Alphonse Daudet's three-act
play "L'Arlésienne." The play and Bizet's music
were given at the <cite>Vaudeville</cite> on October 1, 1872,
and withdrawn after fifteen performances. Bizet's
music comprised twenty-seven numbers. After the
failure of the <cite>Vaudeville</cite> production, the composer
arranged various numbers out of the twenty-seven
in the form of a suite, and these were performed
at a Pasdeloup concert in Paris on November
10, 1872. Ten years after the composer's death the
play of Daudet, together with Bizet's music in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
revised form, was revived in Paris, and it has since
been repeatedly performed there.</p>

<p>The plot of "L'Arlésienne" is thus related by
Mr. Philip Hale: "Fréderi, a young farmer of
Carmague, and the son of Rose Mamaï, of Castelet,
is madly in love with a girl of Arles, a brunette who
is irresistible in the farandole;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and he would fain
wed her. She is not seen in the drama. Fréderi
is told at last that she is unworthy the love of any
honest man; and he, thinking that contempt can
kill passion, swears he will forget her. The baleful
beauty of the woman haunts him day and night.
The maiden Vivette, with whom he has grown up,
wishes to console him; but, when he would woo her,
the woman of Arles comes between them. Thus
tortured by jealousy, hatred, love, despair, on a
night when the peasants are celebrating the Festival
of Saint Éloi, and dancing the farandole to the
sound of flute and tambourine, Fréderi hurls himself
from the garret-window of the farm-house
and dashes his skull against the pavement of the
court.</p>

<p>"As a contrast to this furious passion there is the
pure love of the long-separated shepherd Balthazar
and Mère Renaud. There is also the Innocent, the
young brother of Fréderi, whose brain begins to
work only as the tragedy deepens, and at last is
awakened to full consciousness by the catastrophe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The connection of the several numbers of Bizet's
suite with the action of the play may be briefly
indicated:</p>


<p class="center3">I. <small>PRELUDE</small></p>

<p>The Prelude, which serves also as the introduction
to the play, prefigures two of the chief dramatic
personages: the Innocent, and the impassioned
Fréderi. Prefacing the themes of these two appears
the tune of an old Provençal Christmas song.
There are four variations of this theme, and then
follows the theme of the Innocent, forming the
second section of the Prelude. The theme of
Fréderi's passion constitutes the finale. It is this
theme which accompanies the speech of Balthazar
at the tragic end of the drama: "Go to the window&mdash;you
will see whether one does not die of
love!"</p>


<p class="center3">II. <small>MINUETTO</small></p>

<p>In the complete version of the music for the
play this piece is No. 17 of Act II. The middle
portion has been said to denote "the tender and
resigned affection of the Shepherd Balthazar and
Mère Renaud."</p>


<p class="center3">III. <small>ADAGIETTO</small></p>

<p>This music is played during the conversation
between Mère Renaud and her lover Balthazar in
the Court of Castelet. Mr. Hale has thus admirably
translated the passage:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p class="center3"><small>"BALTHAZAR.</small></p>

<p>"God keep you, Renaud!</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"MÈRE RENAUD.</small></p>

<p>"Oh! O my poor Balthazar.</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"BALTHAZAR</small> (<em>in a low voice</em>).</p>

<p>"It's my fault. I knew you were coming. I should not
have stayed.</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"MÈRE RENAUD.</small></p>

<p>"Why not? To keep your oath? Bah! that is not worth
the trouble. God himself has not wished that we should
die without a meeting, and for this He put love in the
hearts of those children there. And, after all, He owes us
this as a reward for our bravery.</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"BALTHAZAR.</small></p>

<p>"Yes, there was need of courage. Leading my beasts,
I sometimes saw the smoke of your dwelling, and it
seemed to make a sign to me: 'Come! She is here!'</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"MÈRE RENAUD.</small></p>

<p>"And when I heard your dogs bark, and I recognized
you and your great cape afar off, it took all my strength
to keep me from running towards you. And now, at
last, our trouble is at an end, and we can look on each
other without blushing. Balthazar!</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"BALTHAZAR.</small></p>

<p>"Renaud!</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"MÈRE RENAUD.</small></p>

<p>"Would you be ashamed to kiss me now, all old and
wrinkled by years as I am?</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"BALTHAZAR.</small></p>

<p>"Oh!</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"MÈRE RENAUD.</small></p>

<p>"Well, press me close to your heart. For fifty years I
have owed you this kiss of friendship."</p>

<p>This number forms the prelude to the fourth
scene, the Court of Castelet. In celebration of the
betrothal of Fréderi and Vivette, the court-yard of
the farm-house is gay with May-poles and decorations
of cornflowers and poppies. The orchestra
plays an unvarying chime-like figure throughout
fifty-six measures. There is a contrasting episode&mdash;the
entrance of Mère Renaud; then the bell-like
figure is resumed, and continues to the end.</p>

<h2>CHADWICK</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>George Whitfield Chadwick: born in Lowell, Mass., November
13, 1854; now living in Boston</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">DRAMATIC OVERTURE, "MELPOMENE"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></h3>

<p>Chadwick's three principal overtures, "Melpomene,"
"Adonais," and "Euterpe," belong
to that somewhat anomalous class of modern works
which occupy a place on the border-line between
programme music and "absolute" music&mdash;music
which, while constructed according to the classic
rules of design rather than in conformity with a
poetic or dramatic scheme, is yet devoted to the
expression of some mood or idea more definite than
that which one looks for in music that is admittedly
"absolute." In the "Melpomene," "Adonais,"
and "Euterpe" overtures, the composer has given
us no clews as to the particular significance of his
music beyond those conveyed by their titles&mdash;which
are, doubtless, in their case, sufficient to establish a
receptive mood in the hearer. The "Melpomene,"
composed in 1887, was originally intended as a
companion piece to his earlier and seldom-played
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
"Thalia" overture. That was subtitled "Overture
to an Imaginary Comedy," and the sub-title of the
"Melpomene" was intended to be "Overture to
an Imaginary Tragedy." In the published score,
however, the sub-title was omitted, and only the
name of the Tragic Muse<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> was retained as an indication
of the emotional purport of the music. The
overture, as has been said, bears no explanatory
note or preface whatever. Of its emotional outlines
an indication is given in this vivid exposition
of the music by Mr. Rupert Hughes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It opens with the solitary voice of the English
horn.... The woful plaint of this voice, breathing
above a low, sinister roll of the kettle-drum, establishes
at once the atmosphere of melancholy. Other
instruments join the wail, which breaks out wildly
from the whole orchestra. Over a waving accompaniment
of clarinets, the other wood-winds strike
up a more lyric and hopeful strain, and a soliloquy
from the 'cello ends the slow introduction. The
first subject is announced by the first violins
against the full orchestra.... After a powerful
climax and a beautiful subsidence, ... the second
subject appears, ... with honeyed lyricism. Almost
before one knows it he is in the midst of the
elaboration [the development, or "working-out"
section, of a composition in sonata form]. It is
hard to say whether the composer's emotion or his
counterpoint is given freer rein here, for the work
is remarkable both for the display of every technical
resource and for the irresistible tempest of its
passion.... The cheerful consolation of the second
subject provokes a cyclonic outburst of grief; there
is a furious climax of thrilling flutes and violins
over a mad blare of brass, the while the cymbals
shiver beneath the blows of the kettle-drum-sticks.
An abrupt silence prepares for a fierce, thunderous
clamor from the kettle-drums and the great drum.
This subsides to a single thud of a kettle-drum; there
is another eloquent silence; the English horn returns
to its first plaint; but grief has died of very exercise,
and the work ends in a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">coda</i> [conclusion passage] that
... leaves the hearer with a heart purged white and
clean."</p>

<p>The score of this overture, completed in 1899,
bears the following inscription: "In memoriam
Frank Fay Marshall, obiit July 26, 1897." Its emotional
kinship with the great threnody of Shelley
is indicated in the title and in the character of the
music. It might fittingly bear as motto these incomparable
lines from Shelley's poem, which voice
in words the precise emotion which has seemed to
shape the utterances of the musician:</p>

<p class="indent2">
"Oh, weep for Adonais&mdash;he is dead!<br />
Wake, melancholy Mother, wake and weep!<br />
Yet wherefore? Quench within thy burning bed<br />
Thy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keep,<br />

For he is gone, where all things wise and fair<br />
Descend:&mdash;oh, dream not that the amorous Deep<br />
Will yet restore him to the vital air;<br />
Death feeds on his mute voice and laughs at our despair.</p>

<a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></h3>

<p>It has been said authoritatively that this overture
(composed in 1903) follows no definite programmatic
plan; that the spirit which animates
it is adequately suggested by the title. Euterpe,
it will be recalled, was the fourth daughter of Zeus
and Mnemosyne. Her province among the Muses
has been admirably stated by Thomas Heywood,
that seventeenth-century Englishman of amazing
literary fecundity and erudition.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> "Euterpe," he
wrote in 1624, "is called the goddess of pleasantness
and jollities, said to be delighted in all sorts
of pipes and wind instruments, and to be both
their inventresse and guidress.... This is the consequence
and coherence betwixt Clio<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and Euterpe,
according to Fulgentius: we first in Clio acquire
sciences, and arts, and enterprises, and by them
honour and glorie: that obtained, in Euterpe we
find pleasure and delectations in all such things as
we sought and attained.... For Euterpe imports
to us nothing else but the joy and pleasure which
we conceive in following the Muses and truly apprehending
the mysteries of discipline and service."</p>

<h3>SYMPHONIC POEM, "CLEOPATRA"<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></h3>

<p>The narrative of Plutarch, rather than the play
of Shakespeare, has served as the dramatic and
poetic basis of this musical embodiment of the
tragic history of Antony and Cleopatra. The composer
has gone for his basic material to Plutarch's
Life of Antony, from which, according to an
authorized exposition, "those situations having
the most direct reference to Cleopatra have been
chosen for musical suggestion, although the action
of the tragedy is not literally followed." Those
phases of the tale selected by the composer for particular
delineation appear to relate&mdash;in the order
of their place in the score&mdash;to the voyage of Cleopatra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
up the River Cydnus in her barge (that barge
which, "like a burnished throne, burnt on the
water"); the martial approach of Antony; the passion
of the lovers; Antony's melancholy end, and
the burial of the pair in one grave.</p>

<p class="spaceb">The music (it was composed in 1904) opens with
a passage suggestive of Cleopatra's voyage upon the
Cydnus&mdash;a tonal paraphrase of Shakespeare's picture
of that wonderful floating pageant: the barge
whose poop</p>

<div class="indentm">
<div class="indentb ileft6">"was beaten gold;</div>
<div class="indentb">Purple the sails, and so perfumed that</div>
<div class="indentb">The winds were lovesick with them; the oars were silver,</div>
<div class="indentb">Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made</div>
<div class="indentb">The water which they beat to follow faster,</div>
<div class="indentb spaceb">As amorous of their strokes."</div>
</div>

<p>According to an exposition prepared with the
sanction of the composer, the music, after this passage,
proceeds as follows in relation to the progress
of the tragedy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"... A climax for the whole orchestra is succeeded
by an <em>allegro agitato</em> depicting the approach of
Antony and his army. A bold military theme is
worked up to a powerful climax, but soon dies
away in soft harmonies for the wind instruments
and horns. The Cleopatra theme then begins, first
with a sensuous melody for the violoncello, repeated
by the violins and afterwards by the whole orchestra.</p>

<p>"Strange harmonies are heard in the muted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
strings. The English horn and clarinet sing short,
passionate phrases, to which the soft trombones
later on add a sound of foreboding. But suddenly
the Cleopatra theme appears again, now transformed
to a vigorous <em>allegro</em>, and Antony departs
to meet defeat and death.</p>

<p>"The Antony theme is now fully worked out,
mostly in minor keys and sometimes in conjunction
with the Cleopatra motive. It ends with a terrific
climax.... A long diminuendo, ending with a
melancholy phrase for the viola, suggests Antony's
final passing, and Cleopatra's lamentation follows.</p>

<p>"In this part much of the previous love music
is repeated, and some of it is entirely changed in
expression as well as in rhythm and instrumentation.
At last it dies away in mysterious harmonies.</p>

<p>"The work closes with an imposing passage in
which the burial of Antony and Cleopatra in the
same grave is suggested by the two themes now
heard for the first time simultaneously. For this,
Shakespeare's line is, perhaps, not inappropriate:</p>

<p class="indent">
"She shall be buried by her Antony;<br />
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it<br />
A pair so famous ..."</p>

<p>Charpentier, a pupil of the Paris Conservatoire,
won the <em>Prix de Rome</em> of 1887, and
while at the Villa Medici, Rome, composed the
suite <cite>Impressions d'Italie</cite>.</p>

<p>The following explanatory programme, written
by Alfred Ernst, the late French music-critic,
translator, and historian, is illuminating and trustworthy:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p class="center3">"I. <small>SERENADE</small></p>

<p>"It is nearly midnight. Coming out from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">osterie</i>,
the young fellows of the neighborhood sing long, burning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
songs, at times sad, often with a savage accent, under
their betrotheds' windows. These lovesick phrases are
answered by mandolins and guitars. Then the song of
the young men sounds again, and dies away, little by
little.</p>

<p class="center3">"II. <small>AT THE FOUNTAIN</small></p>

<p>"Towards the ravines, where the water-falls spread out,
march the girls, barearmed, barelegged, with their white
chemisettes wide open over their shoulders and tanned
busts. Serious, peaceful, without voice and without a
thought, they walk on, to a calm rhythm that is almost
religious, carrying bronze jugs on their heads, with a slight
swaying of the hips beneath the rigidity of their heads and
shoulders. And it is like a procession of priestesses, proud
and passive, marching their silent march through the burning
brightness of the sunlight, while at times the gay refrain
of the shepherds sounds down from the mountain.</p>

<p class="center3">"III. <small>ON MULEBACK</small></p>

<p>"Towards evening, along the road that winds through
the Sabine Mountains, the mules trot at an even gait, to
the bright rhythm of their bells. That melody of the
violoncello is the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">canzone</i>, sung with full voice by the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mulattiere</i>; and those sweet thirds of the flutes that follow
are the loving song, murmured by the fair girls with deep
eyes, seated, or rather kneeling, in the big carts that go
up towards the village.</p>

<p class="center3">"IV. <small>ON THE SUMMITS</small></p>

<p>"It is noon in the lofty solitudes, in this Desert of Sorrento
which overlooks the town, from whence the eye
embraces the islands and the sea. The strings, with their
long-sustained notes, paint, as it were, the background of
the picture, that extent of sea and country burned by the
sun, that glowing atmosphere; a horn suggests the far-off
bell of a monastery. The flutes, clarinets, harps, tell of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>the twittering of birds, vociferously trilling, as if drunk
with warmth and light. Those violas and 'celli that sing,
that gradually swell their tones, are the soul, the enthusiasm
of the poet, the voice that rises up in the solitude,
while the church-bells grow louder, and the chimes
from Sorrento, from Massa, even from Malfi, awaken those
from the hills, interlace their sounds over a compass of
several octaves, pass over the desert of summits, and are
lost far off over the blue sea. All is peace; some sounds
of bells are still heard, feeble and sweet, in the distant immensity.</p>

<p class="center3">"V. <small>NAPLES.</small></p>

<p>"In this last part of his 'Impressions' the composer has
attempted to paint a musical picture of Naples, its population,
its wholly out-door life, its joyfulness.... At first
we hear scattered vibrations: heat, light, the swarming
crowd. It seems as if songs came from every street,
dance rhythms, the amorous languor of violins, the amusing
plunking of guitars. Calls answer to calls, military
bands play proudly their brazen symphony; dancers strike
the ground with their feet, carry the rocking rhythm of
tarantellas from group to group. 'Tis like the great song
of a people, the hymn of Naples on the shore of its azure
bay, with the intermittent rumbling of Vesuvius overcrowding
the sentimental songs the singers sing on the
quays in their nasal voice.... And evening falls, while
fireworks burst forth in gerbes of light, in bouquets of
stars, which soar and go out over the boundless mirror
of the waves."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<h2>CHAUSSON</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Ernest Chausson: born in Paris, 1855; died in Limay,
June 12, 1889</em>)</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">SYMPHONIC POEM, "VIVIANE": Op. 5</h3>

<p>The subject of Chausson's symphonic poem is
not the familiarly known Vivien of Tennyson&mdash;"treacherous,
malignant, wanton"&mdash;but the
vastly different Viviane of the old French legends.
This delectable creature, the legendary woman who
fired the imagination of Chausson, was a fairy who
inhabited the forest of Brocéliande.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> "More beautiful
than the snow-necked swan," she typified the
beneficence of nature. Merlin, "the old seer that
knew the future as well as the past"&mdash;Merlin, who
was, at various times in the growth of the old
legend, the Celtic Mercury, bard, savant, prophet,
warrior&mdash;was willing, observes Mr. Philip Hale in
an interesting commentary, "yea, eager, to enter
within the magic circle he had taught her [Viviane].
He knew what his fate would be. He longed to
give her this assurance that he would never leave
her." The Armorican tale upon which, in particular,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Chausson based his symphonic poem has been
paraphrased by Mr. Hale from Villermarqué as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Arthur went to Gaul to deliver the king of Little
Brittany and put Berry under the dominion of
the Bretons, and Merlin followed him. After the
deeds were done, Merlin took leave of Arthur for a
time and went homeward through the great forests.
He assumed the shape and dress of a young student.
Finally he came to the forest of Brocéliande, and
there he found a spring, which was visited by a
young maiden who lived in a dwelling near by.
Her mother was the fairy of the valley, and she had
endowed her daughter with these gifts: she would
be loved by the wisest man in the world; he would
obey all her wishes, and he could never force her
to obey his; she would learn from him whatever she
wished to know. And the name of this maiden was
Viviane, which means, in the Chaldæan language,
<em>I shall do nothing</em>. Pleased with her at first sight,
he showed her many strange and wonderful things;
he commanded proud processions to pass by for
her amusement; he said the word, and gardens
smiled before her; and then he left her for a year
with the promise to teach her all that he knew.</p>

<p>"Merlin returned on the eve of Saint John's Day.
She was more beautiful than ever. 'Her skin was
so fresh, so white, so smooth!' And he was well-nigh
mad with love. He taught her how to make
water run where none ran before, to change her
form at will, to put to sleep whomever she pleased.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
'He taught her then this secret and many others:
our Lord God wished it thus.'</p>

<p>"Again Merlin left her to join Arthur; but he
often visited Viviane, who knew him only as a fair
youth. The king would miss him, and send messengers;
but his call would be in vain.</p>

<p>"The hermit Blaise knew the secret of Merlin,
and urged him to keep far from the forest. Merlin
answered: 'I shall never have the courage to abandon
her. Yet I know that once near her I shall
never have the strength to come back to you."</p>

<p>"The hermit said: 'Why do you go if you know
what is to happen?'</p>

<p>"'I go because I gave her my promise. I love
her with such a love that I cannot hold myself
back. It is I, I alone, that gave her this power,
and I shall enlarge it. She shall know all I know.
I could not, I cannot, I do not wish to defend myself.'</p>

<p>"The good hermit left him for one mad, and began
to weep. He embraced him, and Merlin went
away, and he too wept at leaving his dear master.</p>

<p>"Viviane had pondered many ways of keeping
Merlin as her own. This time she caressed him as
she had never done before. She said: 'I wish this
Garden of Joy to stay here as it is, forever, that we
might live here always, we two; that we should never
grow old, never leave each other, never cease to love
in full happiness.' And Merlin told her how to do this.</p>

<p>"They sat one day beneath a bush of hawthorn,
in the shade, on the green grass, and the head of
Merlin was on the knees of Viviane. She passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
again and again her hands through his hair, until
he slept. Then she arose and twined nine times
her scarf around the bush of blossoming hawthorn,
and cast nine spells which Merlin had taught her.
Then she took her seat near him, and put again his
head upon her knees, and she thought it all had
been only play, and that there really was no bewitchment.
But when Merlin opened his eyes
and looked about him, forest, garden, bush of hawthorn&mdash;all
had disappeared, and he found himself
in a castle of enchantment, on a bed of flowers,
prisoner to the love of Viviane.</p>

<p>"'Ah, Viviane,' he cried, 'I shall think you purposed
to deceive me if you now ever go from me!'</p>

<p>"'Sweetheart,' said Viviane, 'how could you
think so? How could I ever leave you?'</p>

<p>"And she kept her word to him."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chausson's symphonic poem was first performed
in Paris (at a concert in the <cite>Cirque d'Hiver</cite>), March
30, 1884. Later it was extensively revised, and
the altered version was played at a Lamoureux
concert on January 29, 1888. The following preface
is printed in the score:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"Viviane and Merlin in the forest of Brocéliande.
Love scene.</p>

<p>"Trumpet calls. Messengers of King Arthur scour the
forest in search of the enchanter.</p>

<p>"Merlin remembers his errand. He fain would fly the
embraces of Viviane.</p>

<p>"Scene of the bewitchment. To detain him, Viviane puts
Merlin to sleep, and binds him with blooming hawthorns."</p>

<h2>CONVERSE</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Frederick Shepherd Converse: born in Newton, Mass., January
5, 1877; now living in Westwood, Mass.</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"THE FESTIVAL OF PAN," ROMANCE FOR
ORCHESTRA: Op. 9</h3>

<p>This symphonic poem, composed in 1899, is
the first of a series of "romances" suggested
to the composer by scenes in Keats's "Endymion."
What portions of the poem inspired this particular
work Mr. Converse has not avowed; yet the statement
is responsibly made that "emphasis is thrown
upon the contrast between Endymion's melancholy
and the joyous pomp of the festival of
Pan"; it may not, therefore, be inapt to quote
those portions of Keats' poem which set forth this
situation:</p>

<p class="indent2">"Now while the silent workings of the dawn<br />
Were busiest, into that self-same lawn<br />
All suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped<br />
A troop of little children garlanded;<br />
Who, gathering round the altar, seem'd to pry<br />
Earnestly round as wishing to espy<br />
Some folk of holiday; nor had they waited<br />
For many moments, ere their ears were sated<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
With a faint breath of music, which even then<br />
Fill'd out its voice and died away again.</p>

<hr class="dot3" />

<p class="indent2">"Leading the way, young damsels danced along,<br />
Bearing the burden of a shepherd's song;<br />
Each having a white wicker, overbrimm'd<br />
With April's tender younglings; next, well trimm'd,<br />
A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks<br />
As may be read of in Arcadian books;<br />
Such as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,<br />
When the great deity, for earth too ripe,<br />
Let his divinity o'erflowing die<br />
In music, through the vales of Thessaly.</p>

<hr class="dot3" />

<p class="indent2">"... Then came another crowd<br />
Of shepherds, lifting in due time aloud<br />
Their share of the ditty. After them appear'd,<br />
Up-follow'd by a multitude that rear'd<br />
Their voices to the clouds, a fair-wrought car<br />
Easily rolling so as scarce to mar<br />
The freedom of three steeds of dapple-brown;<br />
Who stood therein did seem of great renown<br />
Among the throng. His youth was fully blown,<br />
Showing like Ganymede to manhood grown;</p>

<hr class="dot3" />

<p class="indent2">"A smile was on his countenance; he seem'd<br />
To common lookers-on like one who dream'd<br />
Of idleness in groves Elysian;<br />
But there were some who feelingly could scan<br />
A lurking trouble in his nether lip,<br />
And see that oftentimes the reins would slip<br />
Through his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,<br />
And think of yellow leaves, of owlets' cry,<br />
Of logs piled solemnly.&mdash;Ah, well-a-day,<br />
Why should our young Endymion pine away!"<br />

<h3>"ENDYMION'S NARRATIVE," ROMANCE FOR
ORCHESTRA: Op. 10</h3>

<p>This is the second of Mr. Converse's symphonic
poems, or "romances," based upon scenes in the
"Endymion" of Keats (the first, "The Festival of
Pan," is described in the preceding pages). "Endymion's
Narrative" was composed in 1901. The
following explanation of the purpose of the music
was given by the composer at the time of the first
performance of the work by the Boston Symphony
Orchestra in 1903:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"... As I have remarked on the title-pages of
these works, they were <em>suggested</em> by certain scenes
from the poem. I meant by this that there was
no desire or attempt to follow the text, slavishly
and in detail, but merely to give a general reflection
of its emotional phases. As a clew to 'Endymion's
Narrative,' I would say that its idea was
derived from the scene in the poem where Endymion,
oppressed with melancholy feeling, and no
longer cheered by the simple pleasures of his
companions, is withdrawn from the Festival by
Peona, his anxious sister, and led by her to a secluded
part of the wood, where she strives to find
the cause of his despondency and to soothe him
with sisterly affection. Under her influence he
reveals the cause of his sorrow. He then relates
to her what seems to me the spiritual essence of
the whole poem, the struggle of a mind possessed
of an ideal beyond the common view, and yet bound
by affection and devotion to conditions which confine
and stifle its urging internal impulses.</p>

<p>"The piece begins with despondency and indecision.
The hero is harassed by alluring glimpses
of the ideal, and soothed by simple affection and
love. There is a sort of dramatic growth of the
various elements, until finally the ideal comes victorious
out of the struggle, and the ungovernable
impulse rushes exultantly on with the mad joy
of determination."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a>

<h3>"NIGHT" AND "DAY," TWO POEMS FOR PIANOFORTE<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
AND ORCHESTRA: Op. 11</h3>

<p>These tone-poems, composed in 1904, derive their
inspiration from lines by Walt Whitman, which
serve as mottoes for the music. For the first of
the two, "Night," he has chosen this line from "A
Clear Midnight" (in the section, "From Noon to
Starry Night"):</p>

<p class="indent6 small2"> "This is thy hour, O Soul, thy free flight into the wordless."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"This," wrote Mr. Converse to the compiler of
the Boston Symphony programme-books at the
time of the first performance of the two poems,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
"expresses quite completely the mood which I
have tried to create in my music. Of 'Day,' Whitman
says:</p>

<p class="indent6 small2">'Day full-blown and splendid&mdash;day of the immense sun, action, ambition, laughter.'<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a><br />
</p>

<p>"As far as it goes, this describes my [second] poem
very well, but the real essence is lacking, although
it was the best and most fitting quotation I could
find for a motto. The moods of 'action,' 'ambition,'
'laughter,' and of love, too (for the erotic
impulse is suggested in the poem), are all there, but
strung upon and incident to the one predominant
and insistent theme of the struggle of life. This
restless, stirring, eternal energy ... is the main
strain of the poem, and the other emotional phases
are eddies momentarily emerging from it, but always
being absorbed again in it, until at the end
the tragedy of it becomes apparent and dominant.
This is what I have tried to express."</p>

<p>He also points out that the titles are only symbolical;
that he has had no intention "of expressing
the physical characteristics of night and day";
his purpose was "to suggest their psychological
meaning, to put into music the moods suggested
by them."</p>

<a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>: Op. 15</h3>

<p>This overture, composed in 1903, is prefaced in
the score with these lines from Milton's "L'Allegro":</p>

<p class="indent6 small2">
"But come thou goddess fair and free,<br />

<p>This work was composed in 1903-04. The poem
by Whitman which has served the composer as
his poetic point of departure is contained in the
section of <cite>Leaves of Grass</cite> called "From Noon to
Starry Night." The music is intended as an expression
of the emotional and poetic substance of
the poem. "I wished," the composer has said, "to
use the elemental phases of the poem: mystery and
peace; love; war or struggle; humiliation; and finally

joy. So I divided the poem into five parts, and
my music follows this division. Each section is
introduced, or, rather, tied to the preceding one, by
characteristic phrases for trumpet."</p>

<p>For each of these five connected divisions into
which the music naturally falls, some dominant
thought of the poet may be held to suggest the keynote.
As in Whitman's strange phantasmagoria,
there is set before us the spectacle of the human
soul undergoing some of its universal and most
vital experiences. After an introduction in which
the Trumpeter's "liquid prelude" persuades one to
turn from "the fretting world," and whose song
"expands the numb'd, embonded spirit," we witness
our typical human experiencing the transports
of love, the perils and vicissitudes of war,
the cankering perplexities and despairs that afflict
the spirit in its moments of reaction; and, finally,
the assured and confident joy that comes with the
attainment of an ultimate poise and self-mastery.</p>

<p>For the five connected sections into which the
music, upon the authority of the composer, may
be divided, analogies are to be found in Whitman's
poem. Those portions of the poem which correspond
with the successive mood-pictures in the
music may be indicated as follows (only the opening

<h2>DEBUSSY</h2>
<p class="center">(<em>Claude Debussy: born in St. Germain-en-Laye (Seine-et-Oise),
France, August 22, 1862; now living in Paris</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">PRELUDE TO "THE AFTERNOON OF A FAUN"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></h3>

<p>Debussy's prelude, composed in 1892, was
the first of his representative works for orchestra.
It was inspired, as he indicates in a sub-title,
by the singular poem of the French symbolist,
Stéphane Mallarmé, <cite>L'Après-Midi d'un
Faune</cite>. This "eclogue," published in 1876, aroused
fierce contention because of its obscurity and the
uncompromising manner in which it exemplified
Mallarmé's novel poetic method; which was, as Mr.
Edmund Gosse has lucidly stated it, "to use words
in such harmonious combinations as will suggest
to the reader a mood or a condition which is not
mentioned in the text, but is nevertheless paramount
in the poet's mind at the moment of composition."
Mr. Gosse thus interprets "The Afternoon
of a Faun," which has defied literal translation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A faun&mdash;a simple, sensuous, passionate being&mdash;wakens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in the forest at daybreak and tries to recall
his experience of the previous afternoon. Was he
the fortunate recipient of an actual visit from
nymphs, white and golden goddesses, divinely tender
and indulgent? Or is the memory he seems to
retain nothing but the shadow of a vision, no more
substantial than the 'arid rain' of notes from his
own flute? He cannot tell. Yet surely there was,
surely there is, an animal whiteness among the
brown reeds of the lake that shines out yonder?
Were they, are they, swans? No! But naiads
plunging? Perhaps! Vaguer and vaguer grows
the impression of this delicious experience. He
would resign his woodland godship to retain it. A
garden of lilies, golden-headed, white-stalked, behind
the trellis of red roses? Ah! the effort is too
great for his poor brain. Perhaps if he selects one
lily from the garth of lilies, one benign and beneficent
yielder of her cup to thirsty lips, the memory,
the ever receding memory, may be forced back.
So, when he has glutted upon a bunch of grapes, he
is wont to toss the empty skins into the air and
blow them out in a visionary greediness. But no,
the delicious hour grows vaguer; experience or
dream, he will never know which it was. The sun
is warm, the grasses yielding; and he curls himself
up again, after worshipping the efficacious star of
wine, that he may pursue the dubious ecstasy into
the more hopeful boskages of sleep."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The manner in which Debussy has set to music
this extraordinary conception cannot be better
indicated than in the exposition by Louis Laloy,
the French critic: "One is immediately transported
into a better world; all that is leering and savage
in the snub-nosed face of the satyr disappears;
desire still speaks, but there is a veil of tenderness
and melancholy. The chord of the wood-wind, the
distant calls of the horns, the limpid flood of harp-tones,
accentuate this impression. The call is
louder, more urgent, but it almost immediately dies
away, to let the flute sing again its song [the exotic
and dreamy phrase with which the prelude begins].
And now the theme is developed: the oboe enters
in, the clarinet has its say; a lively dialogue follows,
and a clarinet phrase leads to a new theme, which
speaks of desire satisfied; or it expresses the rapture
of mutual emotion rather than the ferocity of
victory. The first theme returns, more languorous,
and the croaking of muted<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> horns darkens the
horizon. The theme comes and goes, fresh chords
unfold themselves; at last a solo 'cello joins itself
to the flute; and then everything vanishes, as a
mist that rises in the air and scatters itself in
flakes."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>This suite was written in 1897-99. In date of
composition it stands, so far as Debussy's more important
works are concerned, between the opera
<cite>Pelléas et Mélisande</cite> (1893-95) and the "symphonic
sketches" <cite>La Mer</cite> (1903-05). The score bears no
explanatory note or elucidation; but the following
"programme" (which, it has been remarked, would
itself seem to require elucidation) is said to have
been supplied by the composer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The title 'Nocturnes' is intended to have here
a more general and, above all, a more decorative
meaning. We, then, are not concerned with the
<em>form</em> of the nocturne, but with everything that
this word includes in the way of impressions and
special lights.</p>

<p>"<em>Clouds</em>: The unchangeable appearance of the
sky, with the slow and melancholy march of clouds
ending in a gray agony tinted with white.</p>

<p>"<em>Festivals</em>: Movement, rhythm dancing in the
atmosphere, with bursts of brusque light. Here,
also, the episode is of a procession [a wholly impalpable
and visionary pageant] passing through
the festival and blended with it; but the main idea
and substance obstinately remain,&mdash;always the festival
and its blended music,&mdash;luminous dust participating
in tonal rhythm.</p>

<p>"<em>Sirens</em>: The sea and its innumerable rhythm.
Then amid the billows silvered by the moon the
mysterious song of the Sirens is heard; it laughs
and passes."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These "Nocturnes" may be sympathetically approached
only when it is understood that they are
dream-pictures, fantasies, rather than mere picturesque
transcripts of reality. The brief characterization
of them by Debussy's colleague, Alfred
Bruneau, is more suggestive than many an elaborate
commentary: "Here, with the aid of a
magic orchestra, he has lent to clouds traversing
the sombre sky the various forms created by his
imagination; he has set to running and dancing the
chimerical beings perceived by him in the silvery
dust scintillating in the moonbeams; he has changed
the white foam of the restless sea into tuneful
sirens."</p>

<h3>"THE SEA," THREE SYMPHONIC SKETCHES</h3>

<p class="indent6 small2">1. FROM DAWN TILL NOON ON THE SEA</p>
<p class="center">(<em>De l'aube à midi sur la mer</em>)</p>
<p class="indent6 small2">2. FROLICS OF WAVES</p>

<p class="indent6 small2">3. DIALOGUE OF THE WIND AND THE SEA</p>
<p class="center spaceb">(<em>Dialogue du vent et de la mer</em>)</p>

<p><cite>La Mer</cite> (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trois esquisses symphoniques</i>) was composed
in 1903-05. Debussy has supplied no programme
other than that contained in the titles of
the different movements. The music is broadly
impressionistic, a tonal rendering of colors and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
odors, of voices imagined or perceived, no less than of
moods and reveries. The comment of the French
critic, M. Jean d'Undine, is suggestive: "How can
any one analyze logically creations which come from
a dream, ... and seem the fairy materialization of
vague, acute sensations, which, experienced in
feverish half-sleep, cannot be disentangled? By
a miracle, as strange as it is seductive, M. Debussy
possesses the dangerous privilege of being able to
seize the most fantastical sports of light and of
fluid whirlwinds. He is cater-cousin to the sorcerer,
the prestidigitateur...."</p>

<p>And it has elsewhere been written of these
pieces, by way of an indication of their mood:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"For Debussy the sea is wholly a thing of dreams,
a thing vaguely yet rhapsodically perceived, a
bodiless thing, a thing of shapes that are gaunt or
lovely, wayward or capricious; visions that are full
of bodement, or fitful, or passionately insistent:
but that always pertain to a supra-mundane world,
a region altogether of the spirit. It is a sea which
has its shifting and lucent surfaces, which even
shimmers and traditionally mocks. But it is a sea
that is shut away from too-curious an inspection,
to whose murmurs or imperious commands few
have needed to pay heed; a sea whose eternal
sonorities and immutable enchantments are hidden
behind veils that open to few, and to none who
attend without, it may be, a certain rapt and curious
eagerness."</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"THE SORCERER'S APPRENTICE"<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></h3>

<p><cite>L'Apprenti Sorcier</cite>, an "orchestral scherzo,"
is a paraphrase of Goethe's ballad, <cite>Der
Zauberlehrling</cite>, beginning:</p>

<p class="indentm small3">
"Hat der alte Hexenmeister<br />
Sich doch einmal wegbegeben!<br />
Und nun sollen seine Geister<br />
Auch nach meinem Willen leben!"</p>

<p>The story upon which the poem is based is contained
in a dialogue of Lucian's, "The Lie-fancier."
Eucrates, so runs the story, became the disciple of
the wizard Pancrates, whom Isis had educated in
the art of magic. "When we came to an inn," relates
Eucrates, "he would take the wooden bar of
the door, or a broom, or the pestle of a wooden mortar,
put clothes upon it, and speak a couple of magical
words to it. Immediately the broom, or whatever
else it was, was taken by all the people for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
man like themselves; he went out, drew water,
ordered our victuals, and waited upon us in every
respect as handily as the completest domestic.
When his attendance was no longer necessary, my
companion spoke a couple of other words, and
the broom was again a broom, the pestle again a
pestle, as before. This art, with all I could do, I
was never able to learn from him; it was the only
secret he would not impart to me; though in other
respects he was the most obliging man in the world.
At last, however, I found an opportunity to hide
me in an obscure corner, and overheard his charm,
which I snapped up immediately, as it consisted
of only three syllables. After giving his necessary
orders to the pestle without observing me, he went
out to the market. The following day, when he
was gone out about business, I took the pestle,
clothed it, pronounced the three syllables, and bid
it fetch me some water. He directly brought me
a large pitcher full. 'Good,' said I, 'I want no more
water; be again a pestle!' He did not, however,
mind what I said; but went on fetching water, and
continued bringing it, till at length the room was
overflowed. Not knowing what to do, for I was
afraid lest Pancrates at his return should be angry
(as indeed was the case), and having no alternative,
I took an axe and split the pestle in two. But
this made bad worse; for now each of the halves
snatched up a pitcher and fetched water; so that
for one water-carrier I now had two. Meantime in
came Pancrates; and understanding what had happened,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
turned them into their pristine form: he,
however, privily took himself away, and I have
never set eyes on him since."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<h2>DVO&#344;ÁK</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Anton Dvo&#345;ák: born in Mülhausen (Nelahozeves), near Kralup,
Bohemia, September 8, 1841; died in Prague, May 1, 1904</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">OVERTURE, "NATURE"<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>: Op. 91</h3>

<p>This overture is the first section of a tripartite
work entitled "Nature, Life, Love," which
was originally intended by Dvo&#345;ák to be performed
as a whole. The second division of this triple overture
is known to-day as "Carnival" (Op. 92), the
third as "Othello" (Op. 93). The three overtures
were first performed at Prague, under the composer's
direction, on April 28, 1892.</p>

<p>Dvo&#345;ák is said to be responsible for the ideas
embodied in the following description of the poetic
scheme of the "Triple Overture," which was published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
in the programme of the concert at which
Dvo&#345;ák made his début in America (at Carnegie
Hall, New York, October 21, 1892):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This composition, which is a musical expression
of the emotions awakened in Dr. Antonin Dvo&#345;ák
by certain aspects of the three great creative forces
of the Universe&mdash;Nature, Life, and Love&mdash;was conceived
nearly a year ago, while the composer still
lived in Bohemia.... The three parts of the overture
are linked together by a certain underlying
melodic theme. This theme recurs with the insistence
of the inevitable personal note marking
the reflections of a humble individual, who observes
and is moved by the manifold signs of the unchangeable
laws of the Universe."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Part I&mdash;"Nature"&mdash;of the "Triple Overture"
was thus interpreted, with the sanction, it may be
inferred, of the composer (the English translation
was attributed to Mr. E. Emerson):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As a typical expression of his fondness for
nature and of the blissful and occasional reverent
feelings which it stirs in him, the composer chose
to present the emotions produced by a solitary
walk through meadows and woods on a quiet summer
afternoon, when the shadows grow long and
longer, till they lose themselves in the dusk, and
gradually turn into the early dark of night. Unlike
Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, the unconscious
summer music of drowsy crickets and birds
is not actually represented by instrumental equivalents.
Subjective feeling only is suggested by the
blithesome introduction melody in F major, which
is ornamented by passages running over the instruments,
like rills of pleasure. It is followed by
an expression of the growing vociferous joy which
all nature proclaims. The more quiet gladness of
the beholder finds voice in the second melody, in A
major, whose spirit is enlivened into a broader universal
gaiety, rising rapidly to a climax, from which the
theme quickly returns to the tranquil pastoral form.</p>

<p>"The so-called 'elaboration' section leads back
to the first key of F major.... The predominating
suggestions henceforth are peace and quietude,
with little interruptions here and there, such as
are occasioned by the sudden rustling of the tree-tops
in the forest or by the subdued exclamations
of a garrulous little brook. All this is done with
a light touch, so that it is left to the imagination of
the listener to supply what the music can but faintly
suggest. Finally, when darkness has set in, there
are only the sounds of night. The pervading mood
of the composer becomes similar to that of Milton's
'Il Penseroso' when night overtakes him, while he
listens to the even-song of the nightingale and hears</p>

<p class="indentm">
"... the far-off curfew sound,<br />
Over some wide-watered shore,<br />
Swinging slow with sullen roar."</p>

<h3>OVERTURE, "CARNIVAL": Op. 92</h3>

<p>This overture is Part II. ("Life") of Dvo&#345;ák's
"Triple Overture," "Nature, Life, Love" (see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
page 85). Its poetic significance has been set
forth as follows, with, it is said, the authority of
the composer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If the first part of the overture ['Nature'] suggested
'Il Penseroso,' the second, with its sudden
revulsion to wild mirth, cannot but call up the
same poet's 'L'Allegro,' with its lines to 'Jest and
youthful jollity.' The dreamer of the afternoon
and evening has returned to scenes of human life,
and finds himself drawn into</p>

<p class="indentm">'The busy hum of men</p>
<hr class="dot3" />
<p class="indentm">
When the merry bells ring round,<br />
And the jolly<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> rebecks sound<br />
To many a youth and many a maid,'</p>

<p>dancing in spirited Slavonic measures. Cymbals
clang, strange instruments clash; and the passionate
cry of the violins whirls the dreamer madly into
a Bohemian revel. Anon the wild mirth dies
away, as if the beholder were following a pair of
straying lovers, whom the boisterous gaiety of
their companions, with clangor of voices and instruments,
reach but dimly. A lyric melody ...
sets in, and almost unconsciously returns to the
sweet pastoral theme, like a passing recollection of
the tranquil scenes of nature. But even this seclusion
may not last. A band of merry maskers
bursts in, the stirring Slavonic theme of the introduction
reappears, and the three themes of the
second overture, the humorous, the pathetic, and
the pastoral, are merged into one, with the humorous
in the ascendant, till a reversion changes the
order. The whole ends in the same gay ... key
with which it began."</p>

<h3>OVERTURE, "OTHELLO": Op. 93</h3>

<p>"Othello" is Part III. ("Love") of Dvo&#345;ák's
"Triple Overture," "Nature, Life, Love" (see
page 85). The official commentator who has been
quoted in the preceding pages concerning the poetic
content of the tripartite work wrote as follows of
"Othello":</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"If the first two parts represented the impressions
of Nature and Life as gay and stirring in
general, the third overture lets Love appear as a
serious and burning passion. The composer has
tried to express some of the emotions engendered
in him by the final scenes of 'Othello' as an embodiment
of both the gentlest and the fiercest expressions
of love. The composition is by no means
a faithful musical interpretation of the Shakespearean
lines, but rather the after-revery of a man
whose imagination has been kindled by the theme
of the play. It begins with ... the prayer of Desdemona
before retiring. While she is still praying
for herself and for her husband, weird sounds in
the orchestra suddenly announce the approach of
the murderer. This is but an effect of the imagination,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
however, for presently the prayer of
Desdemona continues till she falls asleep. Once
more the orchestra announces the approach of
Othello. This time it is he. He pauses at the
threshold. He enters the room, looks long at Desdemona,
and kisses her. The theme changes to an
allegro. Desdemona awakes, and then follows the
cruel, pathetic scene between Desdemona and the
Moor:</p>

<p class="indent2 small2">
"'Alas, why gnaw you so thy nether lip?<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><br />
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame.'</p>

<p>"Her entreaties are answered by the deep threats
of Othello. Gradually the imaginary conversation
becomes tinged with a note of melancholy, and a
regretful love scene ensues, according to the composer,
till the Moor's jealousy and mad revenge
gain the upper hand again. This motif is worked
out at some length ... and especially the deep
notes of Othello's lion-like anger are sounded repeatedly.
In the end he restrains himself no
longer. The scene of anguish follows. Desdemona
throws herself at his feet:</p>

<p class="indent2 small2">
<small>"DES.</small> Kill me to-morrow, let me live to-night!<br />
<small>OTH.</small> Nay&mdash;<br />
<small>DES.</small> But half an hour.<br />
<small>OTH.</small> Being done, there is no pause.<br />
<small>DES.</small> But while I say one prayer!<br />
<small>OTH.</small> (<em>smothering her.</em>) It is too late.<br />
</p>

<p>"Othello rises from the deed, and looks wildly
about him. Then comes the wild, remorseful reflection
that he may have been deceived.</p>

<div class="indent small2">"'... Had she been true,</div>
<div class="indent4 small2">If heaven would make me such another world,</div>
<div class="indent4 small2">Of one entire and perfect chrysolite,</div>
<div class="indent4 small2">I'd not have sold her for it.'</div>

<p>"The choral motif of Desdemona's appeal surges
up from the overlying themes, this time in the
deep tones of Othello. It is his turn to make his
last prayer."</p>

<h3>SYMPHONIC POEM, "THE WOOD DOVE": Op. 110</h3>

<p>This symphonic poem, composed after Dvo&#345;ák's
return to Bohemia from the United States in 1895,
was published four years later. It is based upon "the
like-named<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> ballad of C. J. Erben." Erben's ballad
is founded on the Bohemian superstition that the
souls of those who, while mortal, have lived godly
lives, reappear on earth after death as white
doves. The ballad tells a story which is a variant
upon the ancient tale of the widow who found
prompt solace in the soldier delegated to keep
guard over the body of her dead husband. Erben's
version, which the music of Dvo&#345;ák illustrates, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
set forth in an argument printed in the score. It
runs as follows:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p class="center3">I</p>

<p>"The young widow, weeping and lamenting, follows the
body of her husband to the grave.</p>
<p class="center">"(<em>Andante, marcia funèbre</em>)</p>

<p class="center3">II</p>

<p>"A jovial, well-to-do peasant meets the beautiful
widow, consoles her, and persuades her to forget her grief
and take him for a husband.</p>
<p class="center">"(<em>Allegro; andante</em>)</p>

<p class="center3">III</p>

<p>"She fulfils her lover's wish. A joyous wedding.</p>
<p class="center">"(<em>Molto vivace; allegretto grazioso</em>)</p>


<p class="center3">IV</p>

<p>"From the branches of a freshly budding oak, over-shadowing
the grave of her first husband&mdash;who had been
poisoned by her&mdash;the mournful cooing of the wild dove
is heard. The melancholy sounds pierce to the heart of
the sinful woman, who, overcome by the terrors of an
evil conscience, goes mad, and seeks death in the waters
hard by.</p>
<p class="center">"(<em>Andante</em>)</p>


<p class="center3">V</p>

<p class="center">"Epilogue<br />
"(<em>Andante; più lento</em>)"</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>[The work by which Dvo&#345;ák is most familiarly known in
America&mdash;the symphony in E minor, "From the New World"
(composed in 1893 during Dvo&#345;ák's sojourn in America as
director of the National Conservatory of Music)&mdash;is not programme-music,
except in so far as its slow movement is concerned&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><em>Largo</em> in D-flat major. In this movement, it has
been said with authority, Dvo&#345;ák has essayed a musical publication
of the mode which he found in the story of Hiawatha's
wooing, as set forth in Longfellow's poem. Mr. H. E. Krehbiel,
who, in a sense, stood sponsor for the symphony at the
time of its production, observes that there may be here "a
suggestion of the sweet loneliness of the night on the prairies";
and he speaks of an episode in the middle of the movement
which seems intended "to suggest the gradual awakening of
animal life in the prairie scene"; and a striking use is made,
he remarks, "of trills exchanged between the instrumental
choirs as if they were the voices of the night, or dawn, in converse."
The title of the symphony is explained, as most
readers will remember, by the fact that in it Dvo&#345;ák, by his
own confession, according to Mr. Krehbiel, "sought to encourage
American composers to seek and reflect in their music
the spirit of the [negro] folk-tunes which have grown up in
America. He does not want them to use the tunes themselves
for thematic treatment, for that is not his conception
of the meaning of nationalism in music; but he wants native
composers to study the characteristic elements of those tunes
(for those are the things which make them hit the taste and
fancy of the public) and compose soundly on themes conceived
in their vein. This he did in his American symphony."
The sons of Dvo&#345;ák have recently (1907) put themselves on
record in the following interesting contribution to the history
of this much-discussed symphony: "... the passages of the
symphony and of other works of this American period, which,
as some pretend, have been taken from negro airs, are absolutely
our father's own mental property; they were only influenced
by negro melodies. As in his Slav pieces he never
used Slav songs, but, being a Slav, created what his heart
dictated, all the works of this American period&mdash;the symphony
included&mdash;respond to Slav origin, and any one who has
the least feeling will proclaim this fact. Who will not recognize
the homesickness in the <em>Largo</em> of this symphony? The
secondary phrase of the first movement, the first theme of the
scherzo, the beginning of the finale, and perhaps, also, the melody
of the <em>Largo</em>, which give a certain impression of the groaning
negro song, are only influenced by this song, and determined
by change of land and the influence of a foreign climate."]</p>

<h2>ELGAR</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Edward William Elgar: born in Broadheath, near Worcester,
England, June 2, 1857; now living in Malvern, England.</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">VARIATIONS ON AN ORIGINAL THEME ("ENIGMA"):
Op. 36</h3>

<p>These Variations have an inner history, or,
rather, fourteen inner histories; but precisely
what they are is a secret which is locked within the
breast of Sir Edward Elgar and certain of his
friends. The Variations are fourteen in number,
and their purpose has been publicly avowed by the
composer. In them, he says: "I have sketched ...
the idiosyncrasies of fourteen of my friends; ...
but this is a personal matter, and need not have
been mentioned." The score bears the sub-title
"Enigma," and is dedicated "to my friends pictured
within." Hints as to their identity are contained
in these initials and sobriquets printed at
the head of the different variations:</p>


<ol>
<li>"C. A. E." <em>L'istesso tempo</em>, G minor, ending in major, 4-4.</li>

<li>"H. D. S.-P." <em>Allegro</em>, G minor, 3-8.</li>

<li>"R. B. T." <em>Allegretto</em>, G major, 3-8.</li>

<li>"W. M. B." <em>Allegro di molto</em>, G minor, with end in G major, 3-4.</li>

<li>"R. P. A." <em>Moderato</em>, C minor, 12-8 and 4-4.</li>

<li>"*  *  *." Romanza, <em>Moderato</em>, G major, 3-4.</li>

<li>"E. D. U." Finale, <em>Allegro</em>, G major, 2-2.</li>
</ol>

<p>As to the "Enigma," Sir Edward has thus declared
himself: "The Enigma I will not explain&mdash;its
'dark saying' must be left unguessed, and I
warn you that the apparent connection between the
Variations and the theme is often of the slightest
texture; further, through and over the whole set
another and larger theme 'goes,' but is not played;
... so the principal theme never appears, even as,
in some late dramas&mdash;<em>e. g.</em>, Maeterlinck's <cite>L'Intruse</cite>
and <cite>Les Sept Princesses</cite>&mdash;the principal character is
never on the stage."</p>

<p>The score bears the date-line: "Malvern, 1899."</p>

<h3>OVERTURE, "COCKAIGNE" ("IN LONDON TOWN"):
Op. 40</h3>

<p>At the time of the first performance of this
overture (at a London Philharmonic concert, June
20, 1901), the following outline of the dramatic
significance of successive episodes in the music was
put forth by Mr. Joseph Bennet, presumably with
the authority of the composer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>


<div class="indent small3 spaceb">

<li>CHEERFUL ASPECT OF LONDON.</li>
<li>STRONG AND SINCERE CHARACTER OF LONDONERS.</li>

<li>YOUNG LONDON'S INTERRUPTION.</li>
<li>THE MILITARY BAND.</li>
<li>IN THE CHURCH.</li>
<li>FINALLY, IN THE STREETS.</li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>When the overture was first performed by the
Boston Symphony Orchestra (in November, 1901),
Mr. Philip Hale included in his programme-notes
this more detailed exposition: "The overture is a
succession of scenes: it may be called panoramic.
The scenes are connected by a slender thread. The
composer imagines two lovers strolling through the
streets of the town. The first picture suggested is
that of the animation, of the intense vitality of the
street life. Then comes a section which, according
to the composer's sketch, expresses the 'sincere
and ardent spirit underlying the Cockaigner's frivolity
and luxury.' The lovers seek quiet in a park
and give way to their own emotions. They grow
passionate, but they are interrupted and disconcerted
by the rough pranks of young Cockaigners.
The lovers leave the park and seek what Charles
Lamb described as the sweet security of the streets.
A military band approaches, passes with hideous
rage and fury, and at last is at a safe and reasonable
distance. The lovers go into a church. The
organ is playing, and even here they cannot escape
wholly the noise of the street. To the street they
return, and the former experiences are renewed."</p>

<p>The score, which contains no programme or elucidation
whatsoever, was published in 1901.</p>

<h3>"DREAM CHILDREN," TWO PIECES FOR SMALL

<p>These pieces, published in 1902, are prefaced with
the following quotation from the paper in Charles
Lamb's <cite>Essays of Elia</cite> entitled "Dream Children;
A Revery":</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small2">"... And while I stood gazing, both the children gradually
grew fainter to my view, receding, and still receding,
till nothing at last but two mournful features were
seen in the uttermost distance, which, without speech,
strangely impressed upon me the effects of speech:
'We are not of Alice,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a>

is in two slightly contrasted parts: (1)
A pensive <em>andante</em> movement in G minor, and
(2) a livelier <em>allegretto</em> in G major, which, however,
changes to <em>andante</em> and closes, with grave
sentiment, <em>molto lento</em>.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The correspondence between
the dominant moods of the essay and the
characteristics of the music are obvious and easily
perceptible. The pieces were "sketched long ago,"
says the composer [writing in June, 1907], "and
completed a few years back." The first performance
was at a Queen's Hall Promenade Concert,
London, September 4, 1902.</p>

<p>No more searching and effective commentary
could be written upon this music than that of Mr.
Vernon Blackburn, though its delicately stated
meanings do not lie always upon the surface:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Sir Edward Elgar can go further than the
great English prose poet, and in his music he
delves into the finest things of the life of childhood;
not the precocious things, not the interrogatory
matters which so often puzzle the brains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
elder people, but simply the artless questions of
childhood which are answered never&mdash;it is those
things which appeal to Sir Edward, yet, with his
infinitely fine sense of musical suggestion, are still
never answered. We can easily see why it is that
Elgar chooses out of a great system of idealistic
writing to limit himself for once within the boundaries
of childhood, just the thoughts and the
dreams of youth, that wonderful period in life;
after all, the thoughts and dreams of youth do not
go further than the theories of manhood, and Sir
Edward Elgar therefore reaches a point of interrogation
which ranks among all those many
questions which in music seem to us to continue,
from the time of the Abate Martini, through the
questionings of Gluck, past the art of Mozart and
Schumann, right unto the present day.</p>

<p>"Elgar called into life the children of his dream
just as all the greatest of modern composers may
for the listener revive the feelings that have been
closed behind the gate of his mind. The children
of his dreams touch a musical paternity that may
be ranked among the things that issue from the
paternity of thought. Such a great musician as
Edward Elgar may well dream of those children
who stand on the edge of the horizon, towards whom
he beckons to come over the sea of silence&mdash;who
never come, but who allow him to dream of the
mystery of that which is sometimes forever denied,
but which is at all times the inspiration of highest
thought."</p>

<h3>OVERTURE, "IN THE SOUTH" ("ALASSIO"<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>): Op. 50</h3>

<p>This overture was completed in 1904. These
lines from Byron's "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage"
are quoted in the score:</p>

<div class="indent">
<div class="indentb ileft10">"... a land</div>
<div class="indentb">Which <em>was</em> the mightiest in its old command,</div>
<div class="indentb">And <em>is</em> the loveliest, ...</div>
<div class="indentb">Wherein were cast ...</div>
<div class="indentb ileft8">... the men of Rome!</div>
</div>
<hr class="dot2" />

<p class="indentm">"Thou art the garden of the world."</p>

<p class="ileft spaceb">(Cantos IV., XXV., XXVI.)</p>

<p>The music is said to have been "conceived on a
glorious spring day in the Valley of Andora," and
is meant "to suggest the Joy of Living in a balmy
climate, under sunny skies, and amid surroundings
in which the beauties of nature vie in interest with
the remains and recollections of the great past of
an enchanting country."</p>

<p>Mr. A. A. Jaeger, in the course of an elaborate
analysis and exposition of the overture which is
said to have been prepared with the sanction of the
composer, writes in detail concerning the meaning
of certain passages in the music. Of an episode
which occurs shortly after the beginning (at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
entry of what the musician would call the "second
theme" of the overture), he says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Gradually a calmer mood comes over the
music. The strings are muted, and wood-wind
(clarinet and English horn) and violins are heard in
a little dialogue which seems to have been suggested
by 'a shepherd with his flock and his home-made
music.'... As the music dies away in softest <em>ppp</em>,
the drums and double-basses sound persistently ...
even after the long-delayed second subject proper of
the overture has commenced. So far the thematic
material has been largely constructed of short sequences.
The new subject, on the other hand, is a
long-drawn, finely curved melody of shapely form....
Tinged with a sweet sadness, it is doubtless
meant to suggest the feeling of melancholy which is
generally coexistent with the state of happiness resulting
from communion with nature, a melancholy
which in this case, however, may be supposed to
have been produced by contemplating the contrast
(shown nowhere more strikingly than in Italy) between
the eternal rejuvenescence of nature and the
instability of man's greatest and proudest achievements.
The melody is announced by first violins,
solo viola, and solo 'cello. It is immediately repeated
in the higher octave.... A melody in the
same gentle mood follows." Later there occurs
"a passionately ascending sequence, as if the composer
were rousing himself from a deep revery."
There are trumpet-calls, and the music becomes
increasingly animated. "We reach a second very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
important episode, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grandioso</i>, in which the composer
has aimed to 'paint the relentless and domineering
<em>onward</em> force of the ancient day, and give
a sound picture of the strife and wars of a later
time.' First we have this bold and stately phrase,
very weightily scored for the full orchestra, except
flutes. It is followed by another forceful passage,"
in which are "clashing discords.... Soon the
music grows even more emphatic.... With almost
cruel insistence the composer covers page after
page with this discordant and stridently orchestrated
but powerfully suggestive music. It is as if
countless Roman cohorts sounded their battle-calls
from all the corners of the earth.... It is a wild
scene which the composer unfolds before us&mdash;one
of turbulent strife, in which many a slashing blow
and counter-blow are dealt in furious hand-to-hand
fight.... The Roman motif (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grandioso</i>) seems to
exhort the warriors to carry their eagles victorious
through the fray, that <cite>Senatus populusque Romanus</cite>
may know how Roman legions did their
duty. Gradually the clamor subsides," and, with
a high note sounded on the glockenspiel [an orchestral
implement which produces a bell-like
tone], "we are back in the light of the present
day.</p>

<p>"A curious passage seems to suggest the gradual
awakening from the dream, the bright sunshine
breaking through the dust of battle beheld in a
poet's vision of a soul-stirring past." Later we
hear (solo viola) "the lonely shepherd's plaintive
song, floating towards the serene azure of the
Italian sky." Finally, the overture is brought to
an end with a phrase "which has stood throughout
for the brave motto of Sunshine, Open Air, and
Cheery Optimism."</p>

<a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></h3>

<p>This symphonic poem, composed in 1876, was
suggested by the opening lines of a poem by
Leconte de Lisle, though the derivation is not
avowed in the score. A prose translation of these
lines may be given as follows:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"O floating breezes of the skies, sweet breaths of lovely
spring, that with capricious kisses caress the hills and the
plains!</p>

<p>Æolus was conceived by the Greeks to be a
companion of the gods and master of the winds.
Jeremy Collier wrote of him: "Æolus, a king of
the seven islands betwixt Italy and Sicily called
Æoliæ, very Hospitable, he taught his People to
use Sails, and by observing the Fire or Smoak of
Strongyle (Stromboli) could predict how the Winds
would blow, whence the Poets call'd him the God
of the Winds. He was also a skilful Astrologer,
which contributed to this Fiction. There were
Three of this Name." This is how Ulysses described
to King Alcinous his visit to Æolus:</p>

<p class="indent">
"To the Æolian island we attain'd,<br />
That swum about still on the sea, where reign'd<br />
The God-lov'd Æolus Hippotades.<br />

A wave-beat-smooth rock moved about the wall.<br />

<p><cite>Le Chasseur Maudit</cite>, composed in 1883, tells the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>
<p>"'Twas a Sunday morning; far away resounded the
joyous sound of bells and the joyous chants of the crowd....
Sacrilege! The savage Count of the Rhine has winded
his horn.</p>

<p>"Halloo! Halloo! The chase rushes over corn-fields,
moors, and meadows.&mdash;'Stop, Count, I entreat you; hear
the pious chants!'&mdash;No! Halloo! Halloo!&mdash;'Stop, Count,
I implore you; take care!'&mdash;No! and the riders rush on
like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>"Suddenly the Count is alone; his horse refuses to go on;
the Count would wind his horn, but the horn no longer
sounds.... A dismal, implacable voice curses him: 'Sacrilegious
man,' it cries, 'be forever hunted by Hell!'</p>

terror-stricken, flees faster and ever faster, pursued by a

through the air."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>In the music there is first a portrayal of the
serene Sabbath landscape, the chanting chorus;
there is pealing of bells, and the sacred song rises to
a climax.</p>

<p>Then follows the entry of the ribald huntsmen,

<li>PSYCHE AND CUPID (<em>Psyché et Eros</em>)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Franck composed in 1887-88 a symphony for
chorus and orchestra entitled "Psyché," the text
of which is credited to Messrs. Sicard and Fourchard.
In 1900 four parts of the work, written for
orchestra alone, were extracted and published in the
form of a suite, with the titles quoted above.</p>

<p>The tale of Cupid and Psyche, as told by Apuleius
in "The Golden Ass," has been thus admirably
paraphrased by Mr. H. E. Krehbiel:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Psyche was a mortal, the daughter of a king,
whose beauty was so great that she received the
homage, almost the worship, which was the due
of Venus. Wherefore the goddess resolved to revenge
herself upon the proud beauty, and asked
her son, Cupid, to inspire in her a passion for a
low-born creature unworthy of her. Then should
Psyche be humiliated and Venus come into her
rights again. Cupid set out to obey his mother's
injunctions. Finding the maiden asleep in her
chamber, he anointed her lips with the bitter water
from one of the fountains in Venus's garden, and
touched her side with the point of his magic arrow.
When she opened her eyes she could not see the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
god, who had made himself invisible, but he could
see her, and the sight of her loveliness so unnerved
him that he unwittingly wounded himself with his
own arrow. To make as much reparation as possible
he emptied his amber jar of sweet water over all
her ringlets. But Venus's wishes came near fulfilment.
Psyche did not become enamoured of a boor,
but of all her admirers none came with offerings of
love and marriage. Fearing that the anger of the
gods had been incurred by them, her parents consulted
the oracle of Apollo, and were told that their
daughter should have no mortal lover. Her future
husband, a monster irresistible to both gods and
men, awaited her at the top of a high mountain.
Great was their grief, but Psyche offered willingly
to make expiation for having received honors which
belonged only to the immortal queen of love and
beauty. She was led to the summit of the mountain
and left to her fate. Thence came Zephyrus,
and carried her gently to a flowery vale in the midst
of which stood a magnificent palace. She became
its mistress. Invisible hands administered abundantly
to all her wants, filled her mouth with nectareous
food and wines, and her ears with music. Every
night she was visited by him whom the oracle said was
to be her husband, but she saw him not. He came
only in the darkness of the night, and disappeared
before the break of day. She begged for a sight of
him whose words of love had aroused a deep passion
within her, but he refused. It was Cupid, who wanted
to be loved as an equal, not worshipped as a god.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"But when Psyche's sisters heard of her great
happiness they filled her mind with doubt and misgivings,
and persuaded her to disobey her strange
visitor's commands. Perhaps he was a hideous
monster who would in time devour her. At night,
when he was fast asleep, she uncovered her lamp
and gazed, not upon a monster, but upon the loveliest
of visions. A god lay before her with golden
ringlets clustering about his white neck and ruddy
cheeks, and snowy wings on his shoulders. She
leaned over him for a closer view, and a drop of
burning oil fell upon his glistening skin. He awoke,
and without a word spread his wings and flew out
of the window. With him vanished palace and
gardens. Day and night Psyche wandered about
seeking her lost love. She found herself in the
temple of Ceres, whose pity she awakened, and
who told her to surrender herself to Venus and
seek to win her forgiveness. Voluntarily she submitted
to become the slave of the goddess, who
imposed cruel and impossible tasks upon her, but
she performed them all, with supernatural aid extended
by Cupid. At last the god himself, recovered
from his wound, and, unable to endure the
separation longer, made supplication to Jupiter,
who pleaded the cause of the lovers with Venus,
and won her consent to their union. Thereupon he
sent Mercury to the maiden with a cup of ambrosia,
which, drinking, she became immortal, and was
united forever to Cupid."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The poetic substance of the four movements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
which constitute the work in its exclusively instrumental
form may be briefly indicated as follows:</p>


<p class="center3">I. <small>PSYCHE'S SLEEP</small></p>

<p>"In the dim regions of her dreams, her spirit
becomes aware of some perfect bliss, not of this
world, which she feels will yet be hers."</p>


<p class="center3">II. <small>PSYCHE BORNE AWAY BY THE ZEPHYRS</small></p>

<p>There is first a suggestion of the zephyrs; then
follows a portion which is said to characterize
Psyche herself. A reminiscence of the theme which,
in the first movement, served as a love motive,
follows; then, again, we hear the Psyche theme.</p>


<p class="center3">III. <small>THE GARDENS OF CUPID</small></p>

<p>This movement is a love scene, "a depiction of
the delights of Psyche in the company of her invisible
lover."</p>


<p class="center3">IV. <small>PSYCHE AND CUPID</small></p>

<p>The final bliss of the lovers is said to be portrayed
here. "Love, at first hesitant, grows bold;
it has its passionate flights, its returns to calmness,
its torrents of passion, then its moments of ecstasy.
The themes are so blended or enchained that they
are nearly all of like importance, and often one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
is the conclusion of the other. They are charged
with a penetrating solemnity which touches the
heart-core."</p>

<p>"Eros and Psyche," writes Gustave Derepas in
an examination of the work of Franck in its original
form, "do not appear as individuals. The orchestra
interprets their feelings, and for this reason:
the two are in this poem not individuals. Franck,
forgetting the legendary personages, looks on them
as symbols of the human soul and supreme love.
Music, absolute music without words, because its
notes do not have a definite meaning, is of all the
forms of art the most adequate expression of these
immaterial realities. There are no solos in this
oratorio. The orchestra has the most important
part; it translates the longings, the regrets, the final
joy of Psyche.... It is to be easily seen that the
whole work is charged with the spirit of Christian
mysticism."</p>

<p>M. Vincent d'Indy, a distinguished pupil, as well
as a profound and discerning appreciator, of César
Franck, has observed that when Franck (always a
mystic of mystics) passed to purely profane subjects
his angelic imaginings pursued him. "He was
fain to put the ancient myth of Eros and Psyche
into tones. There are passages of ravishing description
in the music in which he fulfilled his purpose.
But the capstone of the work, the love duet, as it
is called, between Eros and Psyche, has seemed to
me always and only an ethereal dialogue between
the soul as the mystical author of 'The Imitation of
Christ' conceived it and a seraph descended from
heaven to instruct it."</p>

<h3>"THE DJINNS," SYMPHONIC POEM FOR ORCHESTRA
AND PIANO<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></h3>

<p><cite>Les Djinns</cite> was written in illustration of lines
from Victor Hugo's <cite>Les Orientales</cite>, which, translated
into prose, are as follows:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"In the plain is born a sound; 'tis the breathing of
the night.</p>

<p>"The sound draws near. It grows louder! Heavens!
It is the galloping of the Djinns.</p>

<p>"It is their funeral plaint. Hark to them! Cries of
Hell! Voices that howl and weep!</p>

<p>"They depart, ... but the air groans again. Then
silence.</p>

<p>"All passes away, and space swallows up the sound."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The Djinns (or Jinns, from an Arabic word meaning
"to be dark" or "to be veiled") were, in Arabian
mythology, supernatural beings of prevailingly
malevolent character and purpose. They were both
male and female, and were regarded as extremely
long-lived. Created two thousand years before
Adam, of smokeless fire, their homes were in the
mountains named Kaff, which were believed to
girdle the earth. Yet they haunted all places
and all elements&mdash;the sea, the land, the air. They
could assume any form at will, but were prone to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
appear to men in whirlwinds, tempests, and dust
clouds.</p>

<p>In Franck's symphonic poem (in which the piano
is employed rather as an orchestral adjunct than as
a solo instrument) the music delineates the sudden
and terrifying approach through the air of
the horde of tempest-driven demons, their horrible
lamentations and imprecations, their passing and
final disappearance.</p>

<h2>GLAZOUNOFF</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Alexander Glazounoff: born in St. Petersburg, August 10, 1865;
now living there</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"STENKA RÂZINE," SYMPHONIC POEM: Op. 13</h3>

<p>Stenka Râzine (or Râzin), the subject of
Glazounoff's symphonic poem, was a Cossack
rebel and outlaw who flourished in the seventeenth
century. In 1667 he was elected leader of the insurgent
Cossacks, and, after a tumultuous career
of plunder and devastation, was finally executed
at Moscow in 1671. He is the hero of numerous
Russian ballads, and Nikolai Kostomaroff, in 1859,
made him the subject of one of his famous historical
monographs.</p>

<p>In the legend selected by Glazounoff for musical
treatment, Stenka Râzine is portrayed as the hero
of an incident which is related by the composer as
follows in an explanatory note (in French) prefaced
to the score:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"The Volga, vast and calm. For long years the region
about the great river dwelt in peace; then suddenly there
appeared the terrible Ataman [Cossack chief] Stenka
Râzine, who, at the head of his ferocious horde, began to
sweep along the Volga, devastating and pillaging the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>towns and villages situated along its banks. His ship was
splendidly adorned, his sails were of silk, his oars were
gilt; in the midst of a tent of cloth of silver, upon barrels
full of gold and silver, reclined the Persian princess, Stenka
Râzine's captive and mistress. On a certain day she fell
into deep thought, and, addressing her master's comrades,
began to tell them that she had dreamed a dream, in which
it had been revealed to her that Stenka Râzine would
be shot, that his band of warriors would be cast into
dungeons, and that she herself would perish in the waves
of the Volga. The dream of the princess came true.
Stenka was surrounded by the soldiers of the Tsar. Seeing
that the day was lost, Stenka said: 'Never, during all the
thirty years of my raids, have I offered the Volga a gift.
To-day I will give it what is dearest to me among all the
treasures of the earth,' and with these words he hurled the
princess deep into the waves. The fierce band began to
sing in honor of its Ataman, and all hurled themselves
upon the soldiers of the Tsar."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Glazounoff's music is based on three main themes.
We hear first the melancholy chant of the bargemen
on the Volga (derived from a celebrated
Russian folk-tune); by it the Volga is typified
(the theme is announced by the oboe, against
tremolos in the strings). Stenka himself is next
portrayed by a theme that is brutally forceful and
savage. Then follows a gracious and dulcet melody
(sung, <em>pp</em>, by clarinet, with accompaniment of
harp, flutes, bassoon, and horn), in which the princess,
Stenka's captive and beloved, is suggested.
By his vivid and dramatic juxtaposition of these
themes, Glazounoff suggests the progress and culmination
of his tonal narrative.</p>

<p>The score bears the date-line: "St. Petersburg,
1885."</p>

<h3>"THE KREMLIN," SYMPHONIC PICTURE IN THREE
PARTS: Op. 30</h3>

<p>This "symphonic picture" (composed in 1890)
is a delineation, in three sections, of scenes associated
in the imagination of the composer with the
historic and picturesque citadel at Moscow. They
are arranged and titled as follows:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p class="center3">I. <small>POPULAR FEAST</small></p>
<p>(Scenes of festivity, the music based on or suggested by
Russian folk-songs.)</p>

<p class="center3">II. <small>IN THE MONASTERY</small></p>
<p>(There are, first, passages of religious character; then a
section of contrasted quality, with a suggestion of temple
gongs and Oriental color.)</p>

<p class="center3">III. <small>ENTRANCE AND MEETING OF THE PRINCE</small></p>
<p>(The prevailing spirit of this movement is festal. There
is a suggestion of pomps and occasions, of brilliant pageantry.)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>"The Kremlin," writes Mr. Arthur Symons in
his <cite>Cities</cite>, "is like the evocation of an Arabian
sorcerer, called up out of the mists of the North;
and the bells hung in these pagan, pagoda-like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
belfries seem to swing there in a lost paradox, as
if to drive away the very demons that have fixed
them in mid-air.... All the violence of the yellow,
Mongolian East is in these temples, which break
out into bulbs, and flower into gigantic fruits and
vegetables of copper and tiles and carved stone;
which are full of crawling and wriggling lines, of a
kind of cruelty in form; in which the gold of the
sun, the green of the earth's grass, and a blue which
is to the blue of the sky what hell is to heaven,
mock and deform the visible world in a kind of infernal
parody....</p>

<p>"... The priests, with their long hair and Christ-like
presence, wearing heavy vestments of blue and
red velvet and gold-embroidered stuff (in which
one sees the hieratic significance of the blue of the
domes), pass through the concealing door from the
presence of the people to the presence of God, the
door which, at the most sacred moment, shuts them
in upon that presence; and a choir of sad, deep,
Russian voices, the voices of young men, chants
antiphonally and in chorus, weaving, in a sort of
instrumental piece in which the voices are the instruments,
a heavy veil of music, which trembles like
a curtain before the shrine."</p>

now living in Vienna</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">OVERTURE, "SAKUNTALA": Op. 13</h3>

<p>This overture, which made its composer famous,
has been in the European concert repertory
since 1865 (in December of which year it was performed
for the first time in Vienna), and in that of
America since 1877. The music is conceived as a
commentary on Kalidassa's famous Indian drama,
"Sakuntala," the story of which is outlined as follows
in a preface printed in the score:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"Sakuntala, the daughter of a nymph, is brought up in
a penitentiary grove by the chief of a sacred caste of priests
as his adopted daughter. The great king Dushianta enters
the sacred grove while out hunting; he sees Sakuntala, and
is immediately inflamed with love for her.</p>

<p>"A charming love-scene follows, which closes with the
union (according to Grundharveri, the marriage) of both.</p>

<p>"The king gives Sakuntala, who is to follow him later
to his capital city, a ring by which she shall be recognized
as his wife.</p>

<p>"A powerful priest, to whom Sakuntala has forgotten
to show due hospitality, in the intoxication of her love,
revenges himself upon her by depriving the king of his
memory and of all recollection of her.</p>

<p>"Sakuntala loses the ring while washing clothes in the
sacred river.</p>

<p>"When Sakuntala is presented to the king, by her companions,
as his wife, he does not recognize her, and he
repudiates her. Her companions refuse to admit her, as
the wife of another, back into her home, and she is left
alone in grief and despair; then the nymph, her mother,
has pity on her and takes her to herself.</p>

<p>"Now the ring is found by some fishermen and brought
back to the king. On his seeing it, his recollection of
Sakuntala returns. He is seized with remorse for his
terrible deed; the profoundest grief and unbounded yearning
for her who has disappeared leave him no more.</p>

<p>"On a warlike campaign against some evil demons,
whom he vanquishes, he finds Sakuntala again, and now
there is no end to their happiness."</p></blockquote>

<p>Goldmark's <cite>Ländliche Hochzeit</cite> symphony, first
performed at a Philharmonic concert in Vienna
under Hans Richter in March, 1876, is rather a
suite than a symphony. The picturesque significance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
of the various movements, which bear an
obvious relationship to the central idea expressed
in the title, may be indicated as follows:</p>


<p class="center3">I. <small>WEDDING MARCH</small></p>

<p>This movement needs no gloss, since its character
and significance lie upon the surface of the music.</p>


<p class="center3">II. <small>BRIDAL SONG</small></p>

<p>The song may be imagined as being sung by
friends of the bride. It has a second part, with a
tender tune for the oboe (as if one of the bridesmaids
had stepped forward), accompanied by the
theme of the march in the basses.</p>


<p class="center3">III. <small>SERENADE</small></p>

<p>After a prelude, two oboes sing a duet, which is
varied and developed by other instruments.</p>


<p class="center3">IV. <small>IN THE GARDEN</small></p>

<p>This is a love-scene. An impassioned duet is
suggested, in which the tenor is represented by
'cellos and horns, the soprano by the violins and
the higher wood-wind instruments. The movement
ends serenely.</p>


<p class="center3">V. <small>FINALE</small></p>

<p>A peasant dance, spirited and jocose, with a tender
episode in the middle. "For a moment we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
steal out of doors, and are again lost in the rare
strain of the garden scene." In the epilogue "the
simple second tune of the dance [first heard in the
strings] broadens into song, like a festive hymn,
rising to a height of fervent appeal, that is too
intimate for a mere tripping of feet.... The end is
in a climax that is much more than the frolic of a
dance."</p>

<p class="spaceb center">(<em>Marcia e molto marcato</em>)</p>

<p>This is the first, as it is the more famous and
frequently played, of the two orchestral suites
arranged by Grieg from the incidental music which
he wrote, at Ibsen's suggestion, for the latter's
singular drama, "Peer Gynt." The story of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
play, in the form in which it was given by Ibsen to
Grieg for musical accentuation, is thus succinctly
told by Mr. Henry T. Finck in his comprehensive
and authoritative monograph on the Norwegian
master:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Peer Gynt is a rough Norwegian peasant youth,
who, in the first act, drives his mother Aase (Ohse)
to distraction by his fantastic talk and ruffianly
actions.</p>

<p>"His dream is to become emperor of the world.
Everybody dreads and avoids him. He hears
that the beautiful Ingrid is to be married, goes
uninvited to the wedding, and carries the bride
into the mountain wilderness. The next day,
deaf to her laments, he deserts her, after taunting
her with not having the golden locks or the meekness
of the tender-hearted Solvejg, who, at the
wedding, loved him at sight, notwithstanding his
ruffianly appearance and behavior. After divers
adventures Peer finds himself in the Hall of the
Mountain King, where he is tortured by gnomes and
sprites, who alternate their wild dances with deadly
threats; he is rescued at the last moment by the
sound of bells in the distance, which make the hall
of the goblins collapse. Then he builds a hut in
the forest, and Solvejg comes to him on her snow-shoes
of her own free will. Weeping, she tells him
she has left her sister and parents to share his hut
and be his wife. Happiness seems to be his at last,
but he is haunted by the gnomes, who threaten to
torture him every moment of his life, whereat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
without saying a word to his bride, he leaves her
and returns to his mother. Aase is on her death-bed,
and soon expires in his arms. Later, he turns
up in Africa, where he has divers adventures.
Having succeeded in stealing from robbers a horse
and a royal garment, he goes among the Arabs and
plays the rôle of a prophet. He makes love to the
beautiful Anitra, daughter of a Bedouin chief, and
elopes with her on horseback; but she, after cajoling
all his stolen jewels from him, suddenly turns her
horse and gallops back home. In the last act, Peer
Gynt, after suffering shipwreck on the Norwegian
coast, returns to the hut he has built in the forest;
there he finds Solvejg faithfully awaiting his return,
and dies as she sings the tearful melody known as
'Solvejg's Cradle Song.'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Grieg's suite, the "Morning Mood" (<em>Morgenstimmung</em>)
music forms the prelude to the
fourth act of the play. It is a piece of serene and
idyllic tone-painting, with no dramatic suggestions.</p>

<p>"The Death of Aase" is a brief and sombre dirge
on the death of Peer's mother, scored entirely for
muted<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> strings.</p>

<p>"Anitra's Dance" is the music of the dance with
which the daughter of the Bedouin chief tries to
beguile the inconstant Peer.</p>

<p>"In the Hall of the Mountain King" is taken
from the accompaniment to the scene in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Peer, in the dwelling of the trolls, is beset and
tormented by gnomes and imps. The music of
this number has been characterized as "a veritable
hornets' nest."</p>

<h2>HADLEY</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Henry Hadley: born in Somerville, Massachusetts, December
20, 1871; now living in Germany</em>)</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">TONE-POEM, "SALOME": Op. 55</h3>

<p>This tone-poem, "after Oscar Wilde's tragedy,"
is said to have been completed before the production
of Richard Strauss's music-drama on the
same subject.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It is alleged that when Mr. Hadley's
music was composed (it was published at
Berlin in the latter part of 1906), the "Salome" of
Strauss was unknown to him.</p>

<p>The score contains the following programme,
printed in German and English:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"Oscar Wilde's tragedy, 'Salome,' presents first a moonlight
scene of Oriental beauty. Without the palace the
soldiers are keeping guard; within, a feast is in progress.
Salome leaves Herod's banquet and seeks the grateful
cool of the lovely night. John the Baptist (Iokanaan)
has been made prisoner by Herod in an old well. On
hearing his voice proclaiming the Christ, Salome is deeply
moved and determines to see him. She prevails upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the captain, Narraboth, who is in love with her, to have
Iokanaan brought forth. When Salome beholds him, Salome,
the wilful and haughty, who has always triumphed
in her loves, finally herself falls a victim to a consuming
passion for Iokanaan. Notwithstanding her pleadings,
he repulses and condemns her as the daughter of a wicked
woman, while the soldiers reconduct him to his imprisonment.
The music and revelry of Herod's banqueters are
heard. Missing Salome at the feast, Herod leaves the
palace and seeks her. Upon finding her cold and silent
to his advances, he asks her to partake of fruits and wine
with him. This she refuses to do. Finally he begs her to
dance, promising her anything her heart desires, if she
will but consent. At last Salome is persuaded, and dances
the dance of the seven veils for Herod. Delighted and
enchanted with Salome's charms and maddening dance,
he lays half his kingdom at her feet. She will have none
of it, but, reminding him of his promise, demands the head
of Iokanaan in a silver plate. Herod, superstitious and
now thoroughly alarmed at so extraordinary a request,
pleads with Salome. It is of no avail. She will have only
what she demanded. At last, to the utter collapse of
Herod, he is bound to keep his promise. Salome, on
being presented with the head of Iokanaan, fondles and
caresses it, breathing words of passion into its deaf ears.
Herod, in fright of what has been done and in rage and
disgust with Salome, orders her instant death. The
soldiers rush upon her with their spears and put her to
death.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>At the time of the first American performance of
this tone-poem by the Boston Symphony Orchestra,
on April 12, 1907, Mr. Philip Hale published in the
programme-books this exposition of the significance
of the music:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Salome' begins ... <em>Lento e molto tranquillo</em>,
... with a description of the moonlit scene. The
music follows the course of the argument, but
how literally, how imaginatively, must be determined
by each hearer. It will be remarked that
a theme, which might be called Salome's desire,
introduced early in the work after a passage for
solo violoncello (for horns and then for clarinets,
oboes, and English horns), is used at the end of the
tone-poem, '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">con adore</i>' (<em>sic</em>), to accentuate the
address of Salome to Iokanaan's head. 'Salome's
Dance,' <em>Allegretto ben ritmato</em>, with a '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">stretto con
delirio</i>,' is specified by the composer with a title.
The chief motives elsewhere are unidentified by
him. One hearer, then, may take the motive, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">poco
largamente</i>, early in the work, given to trombones
and tuba <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fortissimo</i> with drum-roll, for Iokanaan's
denunciation, and recognize the significance of its
entrance after the dance, while to another the motive
may have another meaning. So, too, there
may be various opinions concerning the precise
significance of other themes. It is enough to say
that the music follows the course of the published
argument. After the dance and the scene in which
Herod consents to the beheading of the holy man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>there is a return to the opening tonality, tempo,
and mood. Themes already typical of Salome are
again used. There is a suddenly introduced and
short <em>Allegro con fuoco</em>. Grand pause: <em>Lento</em>. The
English horn sighs the love theme of Salome."</p>

his highly imaginative and individual art. The

of certain of Böcklin's best-known canvases. This
plan was, however, not adhered to, and now only
the last movement&mdash;the finale&mdash;is avowedly an
endeavor to compose a tonal commentary on various
paintings by the Swiss artist. There is, therefore,
no authorization for an attempt to find definite
translations of Böcklin into tone anywhere save
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in the concluding movement; yet it may be worth
mentioning that the first movement is said to have
been suggested by Böcklin's picture, <cite>"Sieh, es lacht
die Au"</cite> ("See, the Meadow Laughs"), which pictures
two young girls in a meadow plucking flowers,
while others stand about in various postures, one
playing a lute<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>; that the second movement, the
Scherzo&mdash;in a Dionysiac mood of revelry&mdash;is said
to suggest the play of fauns and satyrs of the kind
that Böcklin loved to paint; and that the third
movement hints at moods inspired by his "Sacred
Grove," "Hymn of Spring," and "Venus Anadyomene."</p>

<p>The Finale is in form a theme with variations,
and each variation is named after a picture by
Böcklin. I quote Mr. Philip Hale's concise and
vivid characterizations of the different sections and
the subjects which inspired them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center3">"I. <small>THE SILENCE OF THE OCEAN</small><br />
(<em>In the museum at Bern</em>)</p>

<p>"<em>Adagio molto</em>, E major, 8-8. A dark woman&mdash;woman
only to the waist&mdash;of unearthly beauty lies
on a lonely rock far out at sea. Three sea-birds
listen with her. A strange sea-creature, with man's
face, is stretched beneath the wave. His eyes are
without speculation. His tail floats above the surface,
and is brushed by the woman's hair.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p class="center3">"II. <small>PROMETHEUS CHAINED</small><br />
(<em>1882; owned by Arnhold of Berlin</em>)</p>

<p>"The god-defying hero, a giant in form, is bound
on the summit of Caucasus, which rises abruptly
from the foaming sea. <em>Allegro molto</em>, 4-4. The
theme is taken from the first movement.... The
wild orchestra surges until the end comes, in six
syncopated blows, in extreme <em>fortissimo</em>.</p>

<p class="center3">"III. <small>THE FLUTING NYMPH</small><br />
(<em>1881; owned by von Heyl of Darmstadt</em>)</p>

<p>"<em>Allegretto grazioso</em>, E major, 3-4. A flute solo
that, in alternation with the clarinet, leads into the
familiar theme, in its first transformation, of the first
movement.</p>

<p class="center3">"IV. <small>THE NIGHT</small><br />
(<em>Painted before 1888, and owned by Henneberg of Zurich</em>)</p>

<p>"<em>Adagio ma non troppo</em>, D-flat major, 3-4. A
woman draped in black, but with a shoulder exposed,
floats over a peaceful land, and slowly drops
poppy-heads from a cornucopia. The melody is
played by the violoncellos. Harp, bassoons, double
bassoons, violas, and double-basses accompany.</p>

<p class="center3">"V<em>a.</em> <small>SPORT OF THE WAVES</small><br />
(<em>1883; in the New Pinakothek, Munich</em>)</p>

<p>"<em>Quasi presto</em>, E minor, 2-4, 3-4. Water-men and
water-women frolic in the waves. One woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
gayly dives. Another, frightened, is laughed at by
a bearded and rubicund old fellow, whose head is
wreathed with pond-lilies. A caprice for the wood-wind.
In the section 2-4 the violins continue the
melody, while violin and viola solos ornament, and
harp and triangle add color.</p>

<p class="center3">"V<em>b.</em> <small>THE HERMIT FIDDLING BEFORE THE STATUE
OF THE MADONNA</small><br />
(<em>Painted after 1882; in the National Gallery, Berlin</em>)</p>

<p>"<em>Molto moderato</em>, E major, 3-4. An aged man in
his cell plays with bowed head before the Madonna,
while little angels listen. The strings are hushed.
Organ relieved here and there by flutes, oboes,
clarinets.</p>

<p class="center3">"VI. <small>THE ELYSIAN FIELDS</small><br />
(<em>1878; in the National Gallery, Berlin</em>)</p>

<p>"<em>Allegretto tranquillo</em>, G major, 6-8. One of
Böcklin's most celebrated paintings. A landscape
of diversified and wondrous beauty, with mermaids,
swans, a fair woman on the back of a
centaur crossing a stream, a group in the distance
around an altar. Long-sustained trombone chords
furnish the harmonic foundation. The melody, of a
soft and lightly flowing dance character, is maintained
by the wood-wind and violins, and a horn
reminds one of an expressive theme in the first
movement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p class="center3">"VII. <small>THE DAWN OF LOVE</small><br />
(<em>1868; owned by von Heyl of Darmstadt</em>)</p>

<p>"<em>Andante molto espressivo ed appassionato</em>, E
major, 3-4. Nymphs and young loves in a smiling
and watered landscape. The passionate melody is
given to the strings. Wood-wind and horns take
part in this as well as in the accompaniment. A
short and vigorous <em>crescendo</em> leads to the last variation.</p>

<p class="center3">"VIII. <small>BACCHANALE</small><br />
(<em>Owned by Knorr of Munich</em>)</p>

<p>"<em>Tempo di valse, ma quasi presto</em>, E major, 3-4.
Men and women are rioting about a tavern near
Rome. Some, overcome by wine, sprawl on the
ground. The theme is developed in waltz form.
A rapid violin passage leads to the close, <em>maestoso
ma non troppo</em>. The organ joins the orchestra in
thundering out the chief theme."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A graphic suggestion of that which Huber has
sought to express in his music is conveyed by this
felicitous comment on the art and temperament of
Böcklin, written by Mr. Christian Brinton:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Arnold Böcklin was able to develop a national
art, an art specifically Germanic, because he had
the magic to impose his dream upon his fellow-countrymen,
and because that dream was the reflex,
the embodiment, of all the ineffable nostalgia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of his race, not alone for the cream-white villas of
Italy, the fountains and the cypresses, but for the
gleaming marbles and golden myths of Greece. His
art is merely another version of that <em>Sehnsucht</em>
which finds voice in the ballads of Goethe, the prose
fancies of Heine, or the chiselled periods of Winckelmann.
Once again it is the German viewing Greece
through Renaissance eyes. The special form under
which Böcklin's appeal was made implied a reincarnation,
under actual conditions, of the classic
spirit. He realized from the outset that the one
way to treat such themes was to retouch them with
modern poetry and modern passion. Pan, Diana,
Prometheus, monsters of the deep and grotesques
of the forest, were made vital and convincing.... The
persuasive charm of his classic scenes is chiefly
due to the anti-classic and often frankly humorous,
Dionysian manner in which they are presented.... The
formula of Böcklin's art consists in peopling
sea or sky, shore or wood, with creatures of tradition
or of sheer imagination. Its animus is a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pantheistische Naturpoesie</i>, illustrating the kinship of
man and nature, a conception both Hellenic and
Germanic, which arose from a blending of that
which his spirit caught at in the world about him
and that which came through the gates of fancy and
of fable...."</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">ORCHESTRAL LEGEND, "THE ENCHANTED FOREST": Op. 8</h3>

<p>This work, which the composer calls a <em>Legende-symphonie</em>,

On a fly-leaf of the score is printed, in French,

down from the clouds and start from the torrent's foam?
Who murmur in such harmonious tones and give such

<h3>"SAUGEFLEURIE" ["WILD SAGE"], LEGEND FOR ORCHESTRA: Op. 21</h3>

<p><cite>Saugefleurie, Legende d'après un conte de Robert
de Bonnière</cite>, was composed in 1884. The tale upon
which it is based is from the <cite>Contes des Fées</cite> of
de Bonnière, excerpts from which are prefaced to
the score. The story has been retold in English
prose as follows:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"Once upon a time a young and beautiful fairy, Saugefleurie,
lived humbly and alone by the edge of a lake. The
bank was covered with jonquils. She lived quietly in the
trunk of a willow, and stirred from it no more than a pearl
from its shell. One day the king's son passed by a-hunting,
and she left her tree to see the horses, dogs, and
cavaliers. The prince, seeing so fair a face, drew rein and
gazed on her. She saw that he was handsome; and, as
her modesty was emboldened by naïve love, she looked
straight into his eyes. They loved each other at first
sight, but not a word was spoken. Now it was death for
Saugefleurie to love a mortal man, yet she wished to love
the prince, and was willing, loving, to die. Nor was there
any kindly power to save her. 'My lord,' she said, 'the
fine days are past; do you not find solitude beautiful, and
do not lovers love more warmly when their love is hidden?
If it seem good to you, let us stay here without fear; our
eyes can speak at leisure, and we shall find pleasure only
in dwelling together. My heart will be light if it be near
you. My lord, I give you my life. Take it, and without
a question.' Love and death are always ready and waiting.
Do not think that Saugefleurie, whose fate I mourn,
was spared. She withered at once, for she was Saugefleurie."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The music opens quietly; there is a violin solo;
then the approach of the prince's hunting-party is
suggested. The love-scene follows&mdash;solo first and
second violins, solo viola, and flutes; there is an increase
of intensity, and the music becomes passionate
and stressful. The hunt music returns, followed
by a reminiscence of the love-theme; then the
end.</p>

<h3>"ISTAR," SYMPHONIC VARIATIONS: Op. 42</h3>

<p>"Istar" was first performed in Brussels, under
the direction of Eugène Ysaye, January 10, 1897.
The music illustrates a French version of an ancient
Babylonian poem, "Istar's Descent into Hades,"
the original of which is believed to have been in
the library of Sardanapalus. The French version
of the poem, which is printed as a preface to the
score, has been translated as follows by Mr. W. F.
Apthorp:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"Towards the immutable land Istar, daughter of Sin,
bent her steps, towards the abode of the dead, towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
seven-gated abode where <small>HE</small> entered, towards the abode
whence there is no return.</p>

<hr class="dot" />

<p>"At the first gate, the warder stripped her; he took the
high tiara from her head.</p>

<p>"At the second gate, the warder stripped her; he took
the pendants from her ears.</p>

<p>"At the third gate, the warder stripped her; he took off
the precious stones that adorn her neck.</p>

<p>"At the fourth gate, the warder stripped her; he took
off the jewels that adorn her breast.</p>

<p>"At the fifth gate, the warder stripped her; he took off
the girdle that encompasses her waist.</p>

<p>"At the sixth gate, the warder stripped her; he took the
rings from her feet, the rings from her hands.</p>

<p>"At the seventh gate, the warder stripped her; he took
off the last veil that covers her body.</p>

<hr class="dot" />

<p>"Istar, daughter of Sin, went into the immutable land,
she took and received the Waters of Life. She gave the
sublime Waters, and thus, in the presence of all, delivered
the <small>SON OF LIFE</small>, her young lover."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Mr. Apthorp has thus set forth the peculiarity of
d'Indy's tone-poem (for such it virtually is): "The
theme is not given out simply at the beginning,
neither is it heard in its entirety until the last
variation, in which it is sung by various groups of
instruments in unison and octaves, and worked
up later in full harmony. Each one of the variations
represents one of the seven stages of Istar's
being disrobed at the gates of the 'immutable land,'
until in the last she stands forth in the full splendor
of nudity.... By following the poem, and noting
the garment or ornament taken off, the listener can
appreciate the composer's poetic or picturesque
suggestiveness in his music." Another commentator
has observed that d'Indy has here "reversed
the customary process.... He by degrees unfolds
from initial complexity the simple idea which was
wrapped up therein, and appears only at the close,
like Isis unveiled, like a scientific law discovered
and formulated."</p>

Babylonians and Assyrians. At first a merely local deity, she
ultimately came to be regarded as the personification of fertility
(both of the soil and of human and animal life) and of
war. She corresponded in general to the Ashtoreth (Astarte)
of the Syrio-Canaanites, save that she was conceived as ruling
the planet Venus, rather than the moon, over which Ashtoreth
held sway. Being the representative of the principle of fertility,
Istar was regarded also as the goddess of sexual love.</p></div></div>

<h2>LISZT</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Franz Liszt: born in Raiding, near Ödenburg, Hungary, October
22, 1811; died in Bayreuth, July 31, 1886</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"TASSO: LAMENT AND TRIUMPH," SYMPHONIC POEM
(No. 2)<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></h3>

<p><em>Tasso: Lamento e Trionfo</em>, was conceived as
a "symphonic prelude" to Goethe's drama
"Tasso," and performed during the celebration at
Weimar in 1849 of the centenary of the poet's
birth. It was revised by Liszt in 1854, and published,
in its present form, two years later. The
score contains this preface by the composer:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"In 1849 all Germany celebrated brilliantly the one-hundredth
anniversary of Goethe's birth. At Weimar,
where we then happened to dwell, the programme of the
festival included a performance of his drama 'Tasso,' appointed
for the evening of August 28th. The sad fate of
the most unfortunate of poets had excited the imagination
of the mightiest poetic geniuses of our time&mdash;Goethe and
Byron: Goethe, whose career was one of brilliant prosperity;
Byron, whose keen sufferings counterbalanced the
advantages of his birth and fortune. We shall not conceal
the fact that, when in 1849 we were commissioned to write
an overture for Goethe's drama, we were inspired more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
directly by the respectful compassion of Byron for the
<em>manes</em> of the great man whom he invoked than by the
work of the German poet. At the same time, although
Byron gave us the groans of Tasso in his prison, he did not
join to the recollection of the keen sorrows so nobly and
eloquently expressed in his 'Lamentation' the thought of
the triumph that awaited, by an act of tardy yet striking
justice, the chivalric author of 'Jerusalem Delivered.'</p>

<p>"We have wished to indicate this contrast even in the
title of the work, and we have endeavored to succeed in
formulating this grand antithesis of genius, ill treated
during life, but after death resplendent with a light that
dazzled his persecutors. Tasso loved and suffered at
Ferrara; he was avenged at Rome; his glory still lives
in the people's songs of Venice. These three points are
inseparably connected with his undying memory. To express
them in music, we first invoked the mighty shadow
of the hero, as it now appears, haunting the lagoons of
Venice; we have caught a glimpse of his proud, sad face
at the feasts in Ferrara, where he produced his masterpieces;
and we have followed him to Rome, the Eternal
City, which crowned him with the crown of glory and
glorified in him the martyr and the poet.</p>

<p>"'Lamento e Trionfo'&mdash;these are the two great contrasts
in the fate of poets, of whom it has been justly said
that, while curses may weigh heavily on their life, blessings
are always on their tomb. In order to give this idea not
only the authority but the brilliance of fact, we have
borrowed even the form from fact, and to that end chosen
as the theme of our musical poem the melody to which we
have heard the Venetian gondoliers sing on the lagoons
three centuries after his death the first strophes of Tasso's
'Jerusalem':</p>

<p class="indentm">"'<em>Canto l' armi pietose e 'l Capitano,<br />
Che 'l gran Sepolcro liberò di Cristo!</em>'</p>

<p>"The motive [first given out with sombre effect by the
bass clarinet and three solo 'cellos, accompanied by harp,
horns, and low strings <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pizzicato</i>], is in itself plaintive, of
a groaning slowness, monotonous in mourning; but the
gondoliers give it a peculiar coloring by drawling certain
notes, by prolonging tones, which, heard from afar, produce
an effect not unlike the reflection of long stripes of
fading light upon a looking-glass of water. This song once
made a deep impression on us, and when we attempted to
speak of Tasso our emotion could not refrain from taking
as the text of our thoughts this persistent homage paid
by his country to the genius of whose devotion and fidelity
the court of Ferrara was not worthy. The Venetian
melody is so charged with inconsolable mourning,
with such hopeless sorrow, that it suffices to portray
Tasso's soul; and again it lends itself as the imagination of
the poet to the picturing of the brilliant illusions of the
world, to the deceitful, fallacious coquetry of those smiles
whose treacherous poison brought on the horrible catastrophe
for which there seemed to be no earthly recompense,
but which was clothed eventually at the capital with a
purer purple than that of Alphonse."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The second portion of the symphonic poem, the
"Triumph," is introduced by trumpet calls and
by brilliant passages in the strings. The Tasso
theme, transformed, is proclaimed with the utmost
orchestral pomp and sonority, and brings the music
to a jubilant and festive close.</p>

<a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></h3>

<p><cite>Les Préludes</cite>, composed in 1854, is a tonal commentary
on the thoughts contained in a passage
from Lamartine's <cite>Méditations poetiques</cite>. The score
bears as a preface an excerpt from the <cite>Méditations</cite>,
which may be translated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small2">"What else is our life but a series of preludes to that unknown
song of which the first solemn note is sounded by
death? Love is the morning radiance of every heart;
but in what human life have not the first ecstasies of
awakening bliss been broken in upon by some storm whose
cruel breath dispelled every fond illusion and blasted the
sacred shrine? And what soul, thus sorely wounded, does
not, emerging from the tempest, seek balm in the solitude
and serenity of country life? Yet man will not long resign
himself to the soothing quietude of nature; and when
the trumpet sounds the signal of alarm, he hastens to arms,
no matter what may be the cause that summons. He
plunges into the thick of the combat, and, in the fury and
tumult of battle, regains self-confidence through the exercise
of his powers."</p>

<h3>"ORPHEUS," SYMPHONIC POEM (No. 4)<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></h3>

<p><cite>Orphée</cite>, composed in 1854, was conceived by
Liszt at a time when he was engaged in conducting
rehearsals of Gluck's opera "Orpheus" for performance
at Weimar, and the completed symphonic
poem was first played there, as a prelude to the
opera of Gluck, on February 16,1854. The score contains
a preface by Liszt which forms an admirable
commentary on the spirit and temper of the music:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"One day I had to conduct Gluck's 'Orpheus.' During
the rehearsals it was well-nigh impossible for me to refrain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
from abstracting my imagination from the point of view&mdash;touching
and sublime in its simplicity&mdash;from which
the great master had considered his subject, to travel in
thought back to that Orpheus whose name soars so majestically
and harmoniously over the most poetic of Greek
myths. I saw again, in my mind's eye, an Etruscan vase
in the Louvre, representing the first poet-musician, draped
in a starry robe, his brow encircled by a mystically royal
fillet, his lips parted and breathing forth divine words and
songs, and his fine, long, taper fingers energetically striking
the strings of his lyre. I thought to see round about him,
as if I had seen him in the flesh, wild beasts listening in
ravishment; man's brutal instincts quelled to silence;
stones softening; hearts harder still, perhaps, bedewed
with a miserly and burning tear; warbling birds and babbling
water-falls interrupting their own melodies; laughter
and pleasures listening with reverence to those accents
that revealed to Humanity the beneficent power of art,
its glorious illumination, its civilizing harmony.</p>

<p>"With the purest of morals preached to it, taught by
the most sublime dogmas, enlightened by the most shining
beacons of science, informed by the philosophic reasonings
of the intellect, surrounded by the most refined of civilizations,
Humanity to-day, as formerly and always, preserves
in its breast its instincts of ferocity, brutality, and sensuality,
which it is the mission of art to soften, sweeten,
and ennoble. To-day, as formerly and always, Orpheus,
that is to say, Art, should spread his melodious waves,
his chords vibrating, like a sweet and irresistible light,
over those conflicting elements which rend each other and
bleed in the soul of every one of us, as they do in the
entrails of every society. Orpheus bewails Eurydice&mdash;Eurydice,
that emblem of the Ideal engulfed by evil and
suffering, whom he is allowed to snatch from the monsters
of Erebus, to lead forth from the depths of Cimmerian
darkness, but whom he cannot, alas! keep for his own on
earth. May at least those barbarous times never return,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>when furious passions, like drunken and unbridled mænads,
revenged themselves upon art's disdain of their coarse,
sensual delights by felling it with their murderous thyrsi
and their stupid fury.</p>

<p>"Had it been given me completely to formulate my
thought, I could have wished to render the serenely civilizing
character of the songs that radiate from every
work of art; their gentle energy, their august empery, their
sonority that fills the soul with noble ecstasy, their undulation,
soft as breezes from Elysium, their gradual uprising
like clouds of incense, their diaphanous and azure
ether enveloping the world and the whole universe as with
an atmosphere, as with a transparent garment of ineffable
and mysterious Harmony."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Mr. Philip Hale has thus described the music in
which Liszt crystallized his fancies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"... Harp arpeggios are thrown over soft horn
tones for a prelude, and then Orpheus sings of the
might of his art.... The song of Orpheus becomes
more intimate in its appeal [<em>Lento</em> ... English
horn, oboe.] The passage ends, ... and a short
phrase is given to the first violin. Some hear, in
this phrase, a call, 'Eurydice!' These themes are
used alternately until there is a climax with the
entrance of the first and solemn Orpheus theme,
<em>fortissimo</em>. [Later] the Orpheus song is again intoned
in all its majesty. There is a hush, and the
Eurydice theme is heard. The 'mystical end' is
brought by an alternate use of strings and wood-wind
instruments in the Orpheus song."</p>

<h3>"MAZEPPA," SYMPHONIC POEM (No. 6)<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></h3>

<p>This symphonic poem, composed, in the early
thirties, as a piano piece (it was published as No.
4 of the famous <cite>Études d'exécution transcendante</cite>),
was made over by Liszt for orchestra in 1850.
Both originally and in its final shape the music is
an illustration, not of the familiar poem of Byron,
but of verses in Victor Hugo's <cite>Les Orientales</cite>.
Hugo's lines, in French and German, preface the
score. The following prose translation is by Mr.
W. F. Apthorp:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p class="center3">I</p>

<p>"So, when Mazeppa, roaring and weeping, has seen his
arms, feet, sabre-grazed sides, all his limbs bound upon a
fiery horse, fed on sedge grass, reeking, darting forth fire
from his nostrils and fire from his feet;</p>

<p>"when he has writhed in his knots like a reptile, has
well gladdened his joyous executioners with his futile rage,
and fallen back at last upon the wild croup, sweat on his
brow, foam at his mouth, and blood in his eyes,</p>

<p>"a cry goes up; and suddenly horse and man fly with
the winds over the plain, carried away across the moving
sands, alone, filling with noise a whirlwind of dust, like a
black cloud in which the lightning winds like a snake!</p>

<p>"They go on. They pass through the valleys like a
thunder-storm, like those hurricanes that pile themselves
up in the mountains, like a globe of fire; then, next minute,
are nothing more than a black dot in the dusk, and vanish
into the air like a flake of foam on the vast blue ocean.</p>

<p>"They go on. The space is large. Both plunge together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
into the boundless desert, into the endless horizon
which ever begins over again. Their course carries them
onward like a flight, and great oaks, towns and towers,
black mountains bound together in long chains, everything
totters around them.</p>

<p>"And, if the hapless man struggles, with cracking head,
the horse, flying faster than the breeze, rushes with still
more affrighted bound into the vast, arid, impassable
desert, stretching out before them, with its ridges of sand,
like a striped cloak.</p>

<p>"Everything reels and takes on unknown colors; he
sees the woods run, sees the broad clouds run, the old
ruined donjon-keep, the mountains with a ray bathing the
spaces between them; he sees; and herds of reeking mares
follow with a great noise!</p>

<p>"And the sky, where the steps of night are already
lengthening, with its oceans of clouds into which still other
clouds are plunging, and the sun, ploughing through their
waves with his prow, turns upon his dazzled forehead like
a wheel of golden-veined marble.</p>

<p>"His eye wanders and glistens, his hair trails behind,
his head hangs down; his blood reddens the yellow sand,
the thorny brambles: the cord winds round his swollen
limbs and, like a long serpent, tightens and multiplies its
bite and its folds.</p>

<p>"The horse, feeling neither bit nor saddle, flies onward,
and still his blood flows and trickles, his flesh falls in shreds;
alas! the hot mares that were following just now, bristling
their pendent manes, have been succeeded by the crows!</p>

<p>"The crows; the great horned owl with his round,
frightened eye; the wild eagle of battle-fields, and the
osprey, monster unknown to the daylight; the slanting
owls, and the great fawn-colored vulture who ransacks the
flanks of dead men, where his bare red neck plunges in like
a naked arm!</p>

<p>"All come to augment the funereal flight: all leave both
the solitary holm-oak and the nests in the manor to follow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>him. He, bloody, distracted, deaf to their cries of joy,
wonders, when he sees them, who can be unfurling that
big black fan on high there.</p>

<p>"The night falls dismal, without its starred robe, the
swarm grows more eager and follows the reeking voyager
like a winged pack. He sees them between the sky and
himself, like a dark smoke-cloud, then loses them and hears
them fly confusedly in the dark.</p>

<p>"At last, after three days of mad running, after crossing
rivers of icy water, steppes, forests, deserts, the horse falls,
to the shrieks of the thousand birds of prey, and his iron
hoof, on the stone it grinds, quenches its four lightnings.</p>

<p>"There lies the hapless man, prostrate, naked, wretched,
all spotted with blood, redder than the maple in the season
of blossoms. The cloud of birds turns round him and
stops; many an eager beak longs to gnaw the eyes in his
head, all burned with tears.</p>

<p>"Well, this convict who howls and drags himself along
the ground, this living carcass, shall be made a prince one
day by the tribes of the Ukraine. One day, sowing the
fields with unburied dead, he will make it up to the osprey
and the vulture in the broad pasture-lands.</p>

<p>"His savage greatness shall spring from his punishment.
One day, he shall gird around him the furred robe of the
old Hetmans, great to the dazzled eye; and, when he passes
by, those tented peoples, prone upon their faces, shall send
a resounding bugle-call bounding about him!</p>

<p class="center3">II</p>

<p>"So, when a mortal, upon whom his god descends, has
seen himself bound alive upon thy fatal croup, O Genius,
thou fiery steed, he struggles in vain, alas! thou boundest,
thou carriest him away out from the real world, whose
doors thou breakest with thy feet of steel!</p>

<p>"With him thou crossest deserts, hoary summits of the
old mountains, and the seas, and dark regions beyond
the clouds; and a thousand impure spirits, awakened by
thy course, O impudent marvel! press in legions round the
voyager.</p>

<p>"He crosses at one flight, on thy wings of flame, every
field of the Possible and the worlds of the soul; drinks at
the eternal river; in the stormy or starry night, his hair
mingled with the mane of comets, flames on heaven's brow.</p>

<p>"Herschel's six moons, old Saturn's ring, the pole, rounding
a nocturnal aurora over its boreal brow, he sees them
all; and for him thy never-tiring flight moves, every moment,
the ideal horizon of this boundless world.</p>

<p>"Who, save demons and angels, can know what he suffers
in following thee, and what strange lightnings shall
flash from his eyes, how he shall be burned with hot sparks,
alas! and what cold wings shall come at night to beat
against his brow?</p>

<p>"He cries out in terror; thou, implacable, pursuest.
Pale, exhausted, gaping, he bends in affright beneath thy
overmastering flight; every step thou advancest seems to
dig his grave. At last the end is come ... he runs, he
flies, he falls, and arises King!"</p>

<a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></h3>

<p>Liszt has supplied no programme of any kind to
this symphonic poem (composed in 1851). The
music has been variously interpreted. It has been
said to be a "portrayal of scenes that illustrate some
great national festival"&mdash;"a coronation, something
surely of a royal character"; others have believed
that it was composed to celebrate the fiftieth
anniversary (occurring November 9, 1854) of the
arrival in Weimar of Liszt's patroness and friend,
the Grand-Duchess Marcia Paulowna, sister of the
Tsar Nicholas I. Lina Ramann, Liszt's biographer,
offers the more plausible explanation that the
work was intended as the wedding-music for Liszt
and the Princess Carolyn von Sayn-Wittgenstein,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
between whom, in 1851 (the year of the composition
of the music), a union sanctioned by state
and church seemed at last to be possible. Fräulein
Ramann sees in this symphonic poem "a song of
triumph over hostile machinations"; ... "bitterness
and anguish are forgotten in proud rejoicing."
The programme thus suggested is as acceptable
as any other.</p>

<h3>"THE BATTLE OF THE HUNS," SYMPHONIC POEM
(No. 11)<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></h3>

<p>In the summer of 1885 Liszt conceived the idea
of setting music to a picture by Wilhelm von Kaulbach
(1855-1874), one of the set of six frescos on
a wall of the Raczynski Gallery in the New Museum
at Berlin. The subject of this picture "The
Battle of the Huns" (<em>Hunnenschlacht</em>), is the
legend which tells of the terrific aërial battle between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the ghosts of the slain Huns and Romans
after the struggle outside the walls of Rome, in
451, which engaged the forces of Attila and of
Theodoric the Visigoth. The picture has been
thus described: "According to a legend, the combatants
were so exasperated that the slain rose
during the night and fought in the air. Rome,
which is seen in the background, is said to have
been the scene of this event. Above, borne on a
shield, is Attila with a scourge in his hand; opposite
him Theodoric, king of the Visigoths. The foreground
is a battle-field, strewn with corpses, which
are seen to be gradually reviving, rising up, and
rallying, while among them wander wailing and
lamenting women."</p>

<p>Liszt's symphonic poem (completed early in
1857) has been found by commentators to typify
the conflict between Heathendom and Christianity,
eventuating in the triumph of the Cross. The
comment of Liszt himself, contained in a letter
written in May, 1857, to the wife of Kaulbach, is,
naturally, as authoritative as it is valuable: "I
have been encouraged," he says, "to send you
what indeed truly belongs to you, but what, alas!
I must send in so shabby a dress that I must beg
from you all the indulgence that you have so often
kindly shown me. At the same time with these
lines you will receive the manuscript of the two-pianoforte
arrangement of my symphonic poem,
'The Battle of the Huns' (written for a large orchestra
and completed by the end of last February),
and I beg you, dear madam, to do me the favor to
accept this work as a token of my great reverence
and most devoted friendship towards the master of
masters. Perhaps there may be an opportunity
later on, in Munich or Weimar, in which I can have
the work performed before you with full orchestra,
and can give a voice to the meteoric and solar light
which I have borrowed from the painting, and which
at the Finale I have formed into one whole by the
gradual working up of the Catholic choral 'Crux
fidelis' and the meteoric sparks blended therewith.
As I have already intimated to Kaulbach in Munich,
I was led by the musical demands of the material to
give proportionately more place to the solar light
of Christianity, personified in the Catholic choral
'Crux fidelis,' than appears to be the case in the
glorious painting, in order thereby to win and pregnantly
represent the conclusion of the Victory of
the Cross, with which I, both as a Catholic and as a
man, could not dispense."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<h3>"THE IDEAL," SYMPHONIC POEM (No. 12)<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></h3>

<p><cite>Die Ideale</cite>, conceived in 1856, completed in 1857,
is based on Schiller's poem of that title. The
burden of the poem&mdash;which, to Lord Lytton,
seemed "an elegy on departed youth"&mdash;has been
set forth as follows: "The sweet belief in the
dream-created beings of youth passes away; what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
once was divine and beautiful, after which we strove
ardently, and which we embraced lovingly with
heart and mind, becomes the prey of hard reality;
already midway the boon companions&mdash;love, fortune,
fame, and truth&mdash;leave us one after another,
and only friendship and activity remain with us as
loving comforters."</p>

<p>Schiller's conclusion, which the poet himself admitted
to be somewhat tame, did not satisfy Liszt,
and in a note to the final section of his symphonic
poem he wrote: "The holding fast and at the same
time the continual realizing of the ideal is the highest
aim of our life. In this sense I ventured to
supplement Schiller's poem by a jubilantly emphasizing
resumption, in the closing Apotheosis,
of the motives of the first section."</p>

<p>Liszt's tonal paraphrase, as he pointed out in a
letter to Hans von Bülow, divides itself, after the
introduction, into four (connected) sections, superscribed
as follows: (1) <em>Aspiration</em>; (2) <em>Disillusion</em>;
(3) <em>Activity</em>; (4) <em>Apotheosis</em>. There is no
programme or argument prefaced to the work, but
instead Liszt has printed in the score, as mottoes,
quotations from Schiller's poem. These excerpts,
consecutively arranged, are as follows&mdash;their sequence
will suggest the dramatic and emotional
outlines of Liszt's music:<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The concluding section (the "Apotheosis") of
Liszt's symphonic poem, as it was pointed out
above, has no analogue in Schiller's poem, but was
contrived by Liszt to round out and complete the
poet's conception after what seemed to him a
nobler and more eloquent plan.</p>

<p>The full title of this "symphony" (composed in
1853-54, revised in 1857), which has been said to
be "really a concatenation of three symphonic
poems rather than a symphony, properly so-called,"
is (in translation), "A Faust Symphony; in Three
Character-Pictures (after Goethe), for Grand Orchestra
and Men's Chorus." The names of the
"three characters," Faust, Gretchen, and Mephistopheles,
head the three movements of the symphony.
The men's chorus enters only as an
epilogue to the last movement. The plan of the
work (the score bears no programme or argument),
as lucidly and concisely stated by Mr. H. E.
Krehbiel, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"By means of musical treatment given to four
motives, or themes, in the first movement, the idea
of <cite>Faust</cite> is presented&mdash;a type of humanity harassed
with doubt, rage, despair, loneliness (the first
theme, <em>Lento</em>); his strivings and hopes (second
theme, <em>Allegro agitato</em>); his ideals and longings
(third theme, <em>Andante</em>); his pride and energy
(fourth theme, <em>Grandioso</em>).</p>

<p>"The subject of the second movement is Goethe's
heroine. There is a brief prelude for flutes and
clarinets, which introduces a melody obviously
designed to give expression to the gentle grace of
<em>Gretchen's</em> character (<em>Andante</em>); then a motive borrowed
from the beginning of the first theme of the
first movement suggests the entrance of <cite>Faust</cite> into
the maiden's mind; it is followed by the second
extended melody, which delineates the feeling of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
love after it has taken complete possession of her
soul. This gives way in turn to the third theme of
the first movement, in which the composer had
given voice to the longings of <cite>Faust</cite>, and which
in its development shows the clarifying influence of
association with the <em>Gretchen</em> music.</p>

<p>"In the third movement <em>Mephistopheles</em> appears
in his character as the spirit of negation ('<em>Der
Geist der stets verneint</em>'); it is made up of mimicries
and parodies of the themes of the first movement,
especially the third [Faust's ideals and longings],
which one is tempted to think is made the special
subject of the evil one's sport, because it enables
him to get nearest to <em>Gretchen</em>, whose goodness
protects her from his wiles. By these means Liszt
develops a conflict which finds its solution in the
epilogue sung by the male chorus and solo tenor.
The text is the <em>Chorus mysticus</em> which ends Goethe's
tragedy, the translation of which ... is as
follows:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"'All transient earthly things<br />
Are but as symbols;<br />
The indescribable<br />
Here is accomplished;<br />
Earth's insufficiency<br />
Here grows to event;<br />
The woman-soul e'er leads<br />
Upward and on!'<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>"The outcome of the struggle is plainly indicated
by the circumstance that the words, 'The Woman-Soul,'
are sung to the <em>Gretchen</em> motive."</p>

<h3>SYMPHONY AFTER DANTE'S "DIVINA COMMEDIA"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></h3>

<ol>
<li>INFERNO</li>
<li>PURGATORIO AND MAGNIFICAT</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>This symphony, begun in 1847-48, completed in
1855, is in two parts, the first wholly instrumental,
the last having a choral ending. Prefixed to the
published score is an introduction, interpretative
and analytical, by Richard Pohl, which there is
every reason to believe was inspired, as it was
evidently sanctioned, by Liszt. Omitting certain
not altogether essential passages of philosophic
and æsthetic speculation, Pohl's elucidation is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When Liszt sought to mirror in music so gigantic
a design [as that of Dante's conception], it became
his plan to pass by the dramatic and the philosophic
parts, that play the rôle, in poetry, of sculpture in
architecture. He could view only the ethical (or
æsthetical) idea that forms the outline of the whole.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>He has therefore put no undue strain upon the
means at his command; he has not even charged
them with a novel burden. He has sought to
represent in general merely such feelings as other
masters before him have vented in other forms. In
dramatic music, Gluck, Mozart, and others have
painted the terrors of hell. Grief, longing, and hope
have ever been the main motives of lyric music;
visions of heavenly choirs are an oft-recurring figure
of religious music.</p>

<p>"Dante's poem consists of three main parts. The
first has for its burden the bitter, barren, self-consuming
woe that hurls its blasphemies at goodness
and divine love, the grief that spurns all hope.
The second reveals a suffering tempered by hope,
purged by love, that is gradually dissolved by its
own purifying power. The third part unfolds the
highest fulfilment of hope through love, in that
blessed contemplation of God that can only be
achieved in another life.</p>

<p>"It was thus possible for the composer to preserve
the division of the Dante epic without marring
the symmetry of the subject in merging the borders
of purgatory and heaven. Considerations of art as
of creed must have induced the composer not to
separate the second and third parts in their appearance,
as indeed they are inseparable in an intrinsic
sense. By the cleansing and hallowing that the
soul undergoes in purgatory, it is brought, in an unbroken
course, nearer to the divine presence, until,
freed of every clouding stain, it reaches the full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
contemplation. It lay within the power of music
to present this psychic growth as a general conception
of purgatory itself, although Dante touches
upon this moment of redemption only in a single
episode (in the 21st and 22d cantos). The form
demanded by his design and by his art did not allow
him to linger over this purely lyric side.</p>

<p>"In spite of the merging of the last two parts, it
is easy to distinguish in the outline of Liszt's work
the three original divisions, of which the first corresponds
to Dante's Hell, the second to his Purgatory,
and the third, following the second immediately,
and sustained in an all-embracing mystic
mood, proclaims the heavenly bliss of Paradise."</p>

<p class="center3"><small>INFERNO</small></p>

<p>"The first movement takes us directly to the
gates of Hell, which burst ajar with the thunder-tones
of the first bars while a harrowing recitative
of trombones hurls in our ears the beginning of that
famous legend over the infernal gates:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"'<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Per me si va nella città dolente:<br />
Per me si va nell' eterno dolore:<br />
Per me si va tra la perduta gente!</i>'</p>

<p class="indent2 small2">("'Through me the way is to the city dolent;<br />
Through me the way is to eternal dole;<br />
Through me the way among the people lost!')<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whereupon the trumpets and horns sound the
eternal curse: '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate</i>'
('All hope abandon, ye who enter in.')</p>

<p>"The latter is the main rhythmic motive of the
whole movement; it returns again and again in
varying guise and volume.</p>

<p>"At our first entrance within the gates begins
that demon tumult&mdash;we hear, all about, those tones
of woe, lament, and blasphemy of which the poet
tells in the third canto:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"'<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Diverse lingue, orribili favelle,<br />
Parole di dolore, accenti d'ira,<br />
Voci alte e fioche, e suon di man con elle,<br />
Facevano un tumulto, il qual s'aggira,<br />
Sempre in quell' aria senza tempo tinta,<br />
Come la rena quando il turbo spira.</i>'</p>

<p class="indent2 small2">
("'Languages diverse, horrible dialects,<br />
Accents of anger, words of agony,<br />
And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,<br />
Made up a tumult that goes whirling on<br />
Forever in that air forever black,<br />
Even as the sand doth when the whirlwind breathes.')</p>

<p>"Abyss upon abyss open before our view. We behold
those fearful depths that fall from one circle
to the other, down to the most hideous torture, the
delirium of despair. The <em>Allegro frenetico</em> paints
the madness of despondency, the rage of the
damned, their curses and maledictions. Without
love or rest or solace, they are ever torn along to
that region where the sins of carnal lust are atoned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and a horrible hurricane whirls the condemned
souls about in perpetual darkness.</p>

<p>"Here the tone poet halts. The storm abates;
it ceases for a moment while are invoked the unhappy
lovers, Paolo and Francesca da Rimini. A
dialogue begins, and we hear the lamenting sounds:</p>

<p class="indentm small2 ileft8">
"'<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Nessun maggior dolore,<br />
Che ricordarsi del tempo felice<br />
Nella miseria</i>&mdash;'</p>


<p class="indent4 small2 ileft8">("'There is no greater sorrow<br />
Than to be mindful of the happy time<br />
In misery&mdash;')<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a><br /></p>

<p>"They pass into the <em>Andante amoroso</em> (in 7/4 rhythm),
where the composer is enabled, in the midst of the
sobs of hell, to let us feel the irresistible charm
of youth and beauty. Not of the heavenly kind,
the earthly love still lingers here. But earthly
passion brings its own punishment, and the essence
of its nature seems expressed in the words that
abandon all hope of heavenly bliss. And so the
sudden breaking in of the motive '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Lasciate ogni
speranza</i>'&mdash;though tempered, it is the more ominous
and forbidding&mdash;is a profound touch of ethical
significance.</p>

<p>"When the last glow has passed of this the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
alluring of illusive joys, undreamed-of sounds ascend
from even deeper abysses. Here hide the sinning
souls forgetful of all benefit, contemptuous of mercy,
strangers to all reverence, rebellious in their ingratitude.
The accents here resound of mockery
and scorn and gnashing of teeth. These phantom
shrieks of raging impotence are merged in the
strange harmonies that lead to the returning motive
of the <em>Allegro frenetico</em>. The terrible tumult of the
damned is enhanced at the close by the thought of
the loss of all hope&mdash;a final refrain of the <em>Lasciate</em>,
an all-destroying lightning-blast, seems to reveal
the horrid scene of torture in the bosom of the
archangel of evil himself. The music here seems to
rival the impression of Dante's graphic views and
forceful lines upon our minds."</p>

<hr class="dot" />

<p class="center3"><small>PURGATORIO AND MAGNIFICAT</small></p>

<p>"The episode of Francesca da Rimini, when she
sings of the fatal charm of the sweetest of human
errors, was chosen by Liszt from all the many scenes
of the 'Inferno.' So in the 'Purgatory' we find
one vision taken from the poem. Right in the initial
bars Liszt follows the poet through the first
canto. After the horrors of hell, the mild azure of
heaven calms the risen souls. In ecstasy they greet
the 'Sapphire of the East.' A wonderfully gentle
murmur, quieting the spirit, puts us in dreams of
the sea rocking in eternal radiance. We think of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the ship that glides o'er its mirror without breaking
the waves. The stars are still twinkling before
the nearing splendor of the sun. A cloudless blue
o'ervaults the sacred stillness, where we seem to
hear the winged flight of the angel that soars over
the ocean of infinity.</p>

<p>"This is the first, soul-stirring moment of redemption.
Vanished are all the ghosts of an obstinate
fancy, of a pride that at once exalts and
destroys itself. Dead are the echoes of unbelieving
mockery. The last throes of convulsive blasphemy
have left the spirit free. A solemn, soothing silence
now prevails in which the soul is loosed from painful
rigor, where it breathes freely, though still without
a full pervading consciousness. After the angry
tempest of flaming nights, peace has appeared, but
peace alone&mdash;the dawn, the light, without the sun.
The wearied soul is not yet ready for a more intense
experience. This is perhaps the general meaning
of the introduction (<em>Andante</em>).</p>

<p>"This gentle, passive state, however, is but transitory.
The secret powers and senses soon awaken,
and with them a ceaseless longing. The more it
grows, the stronger the thirst for the divine reality,
the keener the desire for its immediate view, the
deeper is the sense of weakness, of unworthiness,
of inability to reach and comprehend it. Here a
certain dread appears, together with a healing, a
redeeming pain. The barren anguish of envious
impotence has turned to devout penitence. This is,
however, a moment of sombre elegy. Dante has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
uttered its oppression most forcefully in the tenth
canto, where the sinners recall in remorse the good
and beautiful deeds that they have left undone.
There is no other feeling that can so bow down a
lofty spirit.</p>

<p>"Here the main motive sounds as a choral hymn.
A second theme is then sung <em>lamentoso</em>, in fervent
self-reproach, in passive resignation, in unutterable
grief. The fugue is the most fitting figure for the
perpetual play of the feeling at once of retrospection
and of hope. At the height of the fugue the main
motive (of the choral hymn) rises proudly aloft,
presently returns humbly and in contrition, and,
broken by phrases of lament, dies finally away.
Slowly the heavy clouds of inexpressible woe are
lifted. The Catholic chant of the <em>Magnificat</em> proclaims
softly deliverance by prayer, "the breathing
of the soul." We feel that a conquering penitence
is soaring towards eternal blessedness, is leading us
up through the purifying circles to the summit of
the mystic mount that lifts us to the gates of paradise.</p>

<p>"Now we have reached the point when the poet
of the Divine Comedy, at the first song of paradise,
stands on the edge of purgatory and catches the
glow of the divine light, that his eyes as yet cannot
directly bear. Art cannot paint heaven itself, but
merely the earthly reflection in the soul that is
turned towards the light of divine mercy. And so
the full splendor stays hidden from our eyes, though
it grows ever brighter with the purer contemplation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Thus far only, the tonal poet wanders in the footsteps
of the seer; he does not follow him from star
to star, no more than yonder through the various
circles of the damned. The idea of absolute bliss
transcends human description. The composer could
only point to it as a spiritual state that grows from
a chain of experience. The union of the soul with
God, in prayer, is foreshadowed in the instrumentation.
After the sacred glow of divine love has inflamed
the human heart, all pain has ceased, all
other emotion is lost in the heavenly ecstasy of
surrender to God's mercy. The <em>Magnificat</em> of individual
praise, extending to the universe, passes
into a common Hallelujah and Hosanna, that rises
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pianissimo</i> in a mighty scale of ancient tone, and
creed as well, like a symbolic ladder up to heaven.</p>

<p>"For a long time the soul dwells in this blessed
contemplation, that is made sensible by the soft,
invisible choir [a hidden chorus of women]. The
human heart, attaining a full exaltation, is kindled
with a holy fervor and breaks forth with all its
strength into a loud jubilation that embraces all
worlds of men and spirits. The contrition of the
sinner has changed into a knowledge of God and has
awakened a champion of God.</p>

<p>"When the instrumental climax that stresses this
final moment rings out after a pause, again passing
through the seven steps of the scale, and the choir
add a last overpowering Hallelujah, we think of
all the martyrs whom Dante beheld&mdash;holy fathers
and soldiers of God, who died for their faith and
formed the heavenly hosts who surround the throne
of God.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Thus closes this mysterious work with
the sense of eternal reconciliation, of hope fulfilled,
in the glory of transfiguration."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<h3>TWO EPISODES FROM LENAU'S "FAUST"</h3>


<div class="indent6 small3 spaceb">
<ol>
<li>THE NOCTURNAL PROCESSION</li>
<li>THE DANCE IN THE VILLAGE TAVERN (MEPHISTO WALTZ)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>In 1858-59 Liszt composed two orchestral paraphrases
of episodes from the "Faust" of Nicolaus
Lenau (1802-1850)&mdash;<cite>Der nachtliche Zug</cite> ("The Nocturnal
Procession") and <cite>Der Tanz in der Dorfschenke</cite>
("The Dance in the Village Tavern").
These two pieces he desired should be played together;
there was, he admitted, "no thematic connection"
between the two; "but, nevertheless, they
<em>belong together</em>, owing to the contrast of ideas." In
spite of Liszt's wish, however, the two pieces are
seldom heard together, the first ("The Nocturnal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>Procession") being, in fact, but seldom played,
while the second&mdash;generally known as the "Mephisto
Waltz"&mdash;is a familiar number on contemporary
concert programmes. Mr. Frederick Niecks
has thus presented the gist of the first episode,
"The Nocturnal Procession":</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Heavy, dark clouds, profound night, sweet,
spring feeling in the wood, a warm, soulful rustling
in the foliage, fragrant air, carolling of the nightingale.
Faust rides alone in sombre mood; the
farther he advances the greater the silence; he
dismounts. What can be the approaching light
illuminating bush and sky? A procession, with
torches, of white-dressed children carrying wreaths
of flowers in celebration of St. John's Eve, followed
by virgins in demure nuns' veils, and old priests in
dark habits and with crosses. When they have
passed by and the last glimpses of the lights have
disappeared, Faust buries his face in his horse's
mane and sheds tears more bitter than ever he
shed before."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The programme of the second episode, "The
Dance in the Village Tavern" or "Mephisto Waltz,"
has been set forth as follows by Mr. Philip Hale:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Lenau, in this episode of his 'Faust,' pictures
a marriage feast at a village tavern. There is music,
there is dancing. Mephistopheles, dressed as a
hunter, looks in at the tavern window, and beckons
Faust to enter and take part in the sport. The
fiend assures him that a damsel tastes better than
a folio, and Faust answers that for some reason or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
other his blood is boiling. A black-eyed peasant
girl maddens him at first sight, but Faust does not
dare to greet her. Mephistopheles laughs at him,
'who has just had it out with hell, and is now
shame-faced before a woman.' The musicians do
not please him, and he cries out: 'My dear fellows,
you draw a sleepy bow. Sick pleasure may turn
about on lame toes to your waltz, but not youth
full of blood and fire. Give me a fiddle: it will sound
otherwise, and there will be different leaping in the
tavern.' And Mephistopheles plays a tune. There
is wild dancing, so that even the walls are pale with
envy because they cannot join in the waltz. Faust
presses the hand of the dark girl, he stammers oaths
of love. Together they dance through the open
door, through garden and over meadow, to the
forest. Fainter and fainter are heard the tones of
the fiddle: they are heard through songs of birds
and in the wondrous dream of sensual forgetfulness."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It has been recalled&mdash;and the fact is historically
interesting&mdash;that when the "Mephisto Waltz" was
first played in Boston under Theodore Thomas
(October 10, 1870), in a day that knew not the
<cite>Till Eulenspiegel</cite> or <cite>Salome</cite> of Strauss, Mr. John S.
Dwight, a critic of wide influence in the earlier days
of music in America, was moved to stigmatize the
music as "positively devilish, simply diabolical";
for, he held, "it shuts out every ray of light and
heaven, from whence music sprang."</p>

<h2>LOEFFLER</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Charles Martin Loeffler: born in Mülhausen (Alsace), Germany,
January 30, 1861; now living in Medfield,
Massachusetts</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"THE DEATH OF TINTAGILES" SYMPHONIC POEM: Op. 6</h3>

<p><em>La Mort de Tintagiles: Poème Dramatique
(d'après le drame de M. Maeterlinck),<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
pour grand orchestre et viole d'amour</em>, was composed
in 1897. It was written originally for orchestra
and two violas d'amore<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> obbligato, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
played in this form, for the first time, by the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, on January 8, 1898. The
score was subsequently remodelled, the second viola-d'amore
part being eliminated and the prominence
of the remaining solo part reduced; the instrumentation
throughout was changed, and the score amended
in other ways. In its present form it dates from
September, 1900.</p>

<p>Loeffler has not essayed a literal and detailed
paraphrase of Maeterlinck's play. His music is
rather the expression of moods which it suggests,
of emotions aroused by the singularly potent and
haunting conception of the dramatist. A description
and condensed paraphrase of the action of the
play, written by Mr. Philip Hale, is printed on a
fly-leaf of the score.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> It reads as follows:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"<cite>La Mort de Tintagiles</cite>, a little drama for marionettes,
is in five short acts. The characters are the tender boy
Tintagiles; his older sisters, Ygraine and Bellangère; Aglovale,
the warrior retainer, now very old and tired; and the
three handmaidens of the Queen.</p>

<p>"Tintagiles is the future monarch of the nameless land
in the strange years of legends. He and his sisters are
living in a gloomy and airless castle far down in a valley;
and in a tower that shows at night red-litten windows
lurks the enthroned Queen. The serene ancients portrayed
Death as beautiful of face; but this Queen in the
nameless land is not beautiful in any way; she is fat as a
sated spider. She squats alone in the tower. They that
serve her do not go out by day. The Queen is very old;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
she is jealous, she cannot brook the thought of another on
the throne. They that by chance have seen her will not
speak of her&mdash;and some whisper that they who are thus
silent did not dare to look upon her. 'Tis she who commanded
that Tintagiles, her orphaned grandson, should be
brought over the sea to the sombre castle where Ygraine
and Bellangère have passed years, as blind fish in the dull
pool of a cavern.</p>

<p>"The sea howls, the trees groan, but Tintagiles sleeps
after his fear and tears. The sisters bar the chamber
door, for Bellangère has heard strange muttering in rambling,
obscure corridors, chuckling over the child whom
the Queen would fain see. Ygraine is all of a tremble;
nevertheless, she believes half-heartedly and for the nonce
that he may yet be spared; then she remembers how the
Horror in the tower has been as a tombstone pressing
down her soul. Aglovale cannot be of aid, he is so old, so
weary of it all. Her bare and slender arms are all that is
between the boy and the hideous Queen of Darkness and
of Terror.</p>

<p>"Tintagiles awakes. He suffers and knows not why.
He hears a vague something at the door, and others hear it.
A key grinds in the lock outside. The door opens slowly.
Of what avail is Aglovale's sword used as a bar? It
breaks. The door is opened wider, but there is neither
sight nor sound of an intruder. The boy has fainted, and
the chamber suddenly is cold and quiet. Tintagiles is again
conscious and he shrieks. The door closes mysteriously.</p>

<p>"Watchers and boy are at last asleep. The veiled
handmaidens whisper in the corridor; they enter stealthily
and snatch Tintagiles from the warm and sheltering arms
of life. A cry comes from him: 'Sister Ygraine!' a cry as
from some one afar off.</p>

<p>"The sister, haggard, with lamp in hand, agonizes in a
sombre vault, a vault that is black and cold; agonizes
before a huge iron door in the tower tomb. The keyless
door is a forbidding thing sealed in the wall. She has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>tracked Tintagiles by his golden curls found on the steps,
along the walls. A little hand knocks feebly on the other
side of the door; a weak voice cries to her. He will die
if she does not come to him, and quickly; for he has struck
the Queen, who is hurrying towards him. Even now he
hears her panting in pursuit; even now she is about to
clutch him. He can see a glimmer of the lamp through
a crevice which is so small that a needle could hardly make
its way. The hands of Ygraine are bruised, her nails are
torn, she dashes the lamp against the door in her wild
endeavor, and she, too, is in the blackness of darkness.
Death has Tintagiles by the throat. 'Defend yourself!'
screams the sister: 'don't be afraid of her! One moment
and I'll be with you! Tintagiles? Tintagiles? Answer
me! Help! Where are you? I'll aid you!&mdash;kiss me!&mdash;through
the door!&mdash;here's the place!&mdash;here!' The voice
of Tintagiles&mdash;how faint it is!&mdash;is heard through the door
for the last time: 'I kiss you, too&mdash;here&mdash;Sister Ygraine!
Sister Ygraine! Oh!' The little body falls.</p>

<p>"Ygraine bursts into wailing and impotent raging. She
beseeches in vain the hidden, noiseless monster....</p>

<p>"Long and inexorable silence. Ygraine would spit on
the Destroyer, but she sinks down and sobs gently in the
darkness, with her arms on the keyless door of iron."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Loeffler's music opens with a suggestion of the
sombre and portentous scene which begins the
drama; a suggestion of the gathering storm, the
tossing trees, the wild and sinister night. A mood
is created&mdash;a mood appropriate to the prevailing
emotional atmosphere of the play; and this mood
is developed in the music without particular relation
to the progress of the drama until near the
close, where the composer takes up the thread of the
action at the point in the last act were Ygraine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
waiting in agonized vigil before the keyless door of
iron, hears, from behind the barrier, the despairing
voice and piteous appeals of the doomed Tintagiles.
Here the music becomes definitely dramatic in its
expression: "There is the plaintive voice of the
timorous child; there are the terrifying steps in the
corridor, the steps as of many, who do not walk as
other beings, yet they draw near and whisper without
the guarded door." As the themes of the score
were conceived in accordance with the spirit of the
play, it may be pointed out, on the authority of the
composer, that there are musical symbols for certain
of its principal characters and events. Thus
a forbidding and threatening phrase which occurs
persistently throughout (its first appearance is near
the beginning, where it is declaimed, <em>forte</em>, by
double-basses, 'cellos, bassoons, and bass clarinet,
against string tremolos and agitated runs in the
higher wood-wind) typifies the Dread Queen, the
Queen of Darkness and of Terror&mdash;or, not to put
too fine a point upon it, the idea of predestined and
over-shadowing death: for, as it has been observed
of another of Maeterlinck's plays, "the symbol
floats like a flag" in this drama. The plaintive
and dolorous tones of the viola d'amore may be
said to voice the pathos of those who are foredoomed&mdash;typified
in the play by the child Tintagiles.
The culminating and concluding scene of
the tragedy has its counterpart in the climax of
the symphonic poem: an anguished <em>crescendo</em> ascent
of the strings and wood-wind, <em>allegro frenetico</em>,
punctuated by gasping ejaculations of trumpets
and cornets, is suddenly cut short, as it were,
in mid-air, while above a roll of the drums and
the sinister vibration of the gong the theme of the
Evil Queen&mdash;the theme of Death&mdash;is proclaimed
<em>fortissimo</em> by violins, English horn, and clarinet.
Then begins an epilogue which has no actual equivalent
in the drama&mdash;which transcends yet fulfils it.
The ending of the play is grievous and terrible in
the extreme, but the ending of the tone-poem, while
it is conceived in a mood of deep and piercing sadness,
is at once elegiac and tender: violins and horns
intone, <em>molto dolente</em>, a poignant phrase most acutely
harmonized; 'cellos and double-basses recall the
Death theme; the 'cellos alone sing an expressive
phrase which bears a striking resemblance to a melodic
idea in the composer's song, <cite>Les Paons</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and
this introduces a <em>cantabile</em> passage, of intense and
vivid sweetness (likewise suggestive of <cite>Les Paons</cite>),
for strings, brass, wood-wind, and harp. The music
dies away with long-sustained chords, <em>piano</em>, in the
trombones, trumpets, horns, and higher wood-wind.</p>

<h3>"POEM" ["LA BONNE CHANSON"]: Op. 8</h3>

<p>In 1901 Loeffler wrote, as a companion piece to
his <cite>Villanelle du Diable</cite> (see the following pages),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
an "aubade" for orchestra inspired by Paul Verlaine's
ecstatic lines addressed to his bride, Mathilde
Mauté, and printed in the volume of poems entitled
<cite>La Bonne Chanson</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Loeffler's paraphrase was
originally entitled <cite>Avant que tu ne t'en ailles</cite>, after
the opening line of the poem; later this was changed
to <cite>La Bonne Chanson</cite>; the title finally chosen by
the composer is the French of that given above&mdash;<cite>Poème</cite>.</p>

<p>Verlaine's poem, in English prose, is as follows:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"Before you fade and disappear, pale morning-star&mdash;a
thousand quails call in the thyme&mdash;</p>

<p>"Turn towards the poet, whose eyes brim with love&mdash;the
lark mounts skyward with the day&mdash;</p>

<p>"Turn your face which the dawn drowns in its blue&mdash;what
joy among ripe wheat-fields!&mdash;</p>

<p>"Make my thought shine yonder&mdash;far off, O so far!&mdash;The
dew shines brightly on the hay&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the sweet dream wherein my love still sleeping
stirs&mdash;Quick! be quick! for, lo, the golden sun!"
<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Loeffler's tonal translation of Verlaine's poem is
in spirit a rhapsody, in form "a fantastic kind
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">thème varié</i>" (theme with variations), as he
describes it, "the theme appearing even in canonic
form and in inversion."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The music opens with a
passage suggestive of the opening verse of the poem:
harp, glockenspiel,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and strings evoke the thought
of the early dawn, the fading and disappearing star.
The strings sing the principal theme. After an
<em>allegro</em> passage (some will find here the thought of
the ascending lark), there is a return to the serener
mood of the opening; antique cymbals hint at the
sparkle of the dew on the hay. The music keeps
pace with the mounting eagerness and desire of the
poet-lover; the excitement grows, reaching its climax
in an effulgent outburst of the full orchestra,
announcing the rising sun.</p>

<h3>"THE DEVIL'S VILLANELLE," SYMPHONIC FANTASIA:
Op. 9</h3>

<p><cite>La Villanelle du Diable, d'après un poème de M.
Rollinat, Fantasie symphonique, pour grand orchestre</cite>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<em>et orgue</em>, was composed in 1901. Its subject
is Maurice Rollinat's<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> strange poem, <cite>La Villanelle
du Diable</cite>. A "villanelle" (in the sense
in which the term is used by Rollinat) is an old
verse-form in which a couplet is followed by a refrain.
In Rollinat's poem there are two alternating
refrains, or burdens, which are united at the end.</p>

<p>The first is:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"Hell's a-burning, burning, burning."<br />
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'enfer brûle, brûle, brûle.</i>)</p>

<p>the second:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"The Devil, prowling, runs about."<br />
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Diable rôde et circule.</i>)</p>

<p>Each refrain has been given a musical counterpart
by the composer, and each couplet is illustrated,
though suggestively rather than in literal detail.</p>

<p>The following prose translation of Rollinat's
verses, made by Mr. Philip Hale, is prefixed to the
published score of Loeffler's fantasia:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"Hell's a-burning, burning, burning.
Chuckling in clear staccato, the Devil,
prowling, runs about.</p>

<p>"He watches, advances, retreats like zig-zag
lightning; Hell's a-burning, burning,
burning.</p>

<p>"In dive and cell, underground and in the
air, the Devil, prowling, runs about.</p>

<p>"Now he is flower, dragon-fly, woman,
black cat, green snake; Hell's a-burning,
burning, burning.</p>

<p>"And now, with pointed mustache, scented
with vetiver, the Devil, prowling, runs
about.</p>

<p>"Wherever mankind swarms, without
rest, summer and winter, Hell's a-burning,
burning, burning.</p>

<p>"From alcove to hall, and on the rail-ways,
the Devil, prowling, runs about.</p>

<p>"He is Mr. Seen-at-Night, who saunters
with staring eyes. Hell's a-burning, burning,
burning.</p>

<p>"There floating as a bubble, here squirming
as a worm, the Devil, prowling, runs
about.</p>

<p>"He's grand seigneur, tough, student,
teacher. Hell's a-burning, burning, burning.</p>

<p>"He inoculates each soul with his bitter
whispering: the Devil, prowling, runs about.</p>
<p>"He promises, bargains, stipulates in gentle
or proud tones. Hell's a-burning, burning,
burning.</p>

<p>"Mocking pitilessly the unfortunate whom
he destroys, the Devil, prowling, runs about.</p>

<p>"He makes goodness ridiculous and the
old man futile. Hell's a-burning, burning,
burning.</p>

<p>"At the home of priest or sceptic, whose
soul and body he wishes, the Devil, prowling,
runs about.</p>

<p>"Beware of him to whom he toadies,
and whom he calls 'My dear sir.' Hell's
a-burning, burning, burning.</p>

<p>"Friend of the tarantula, darkness, the
odd number, the Devil, prowling, runs about.</p>

<p>"&mdash;My clock strikes midnight. If I
should go to see Lucifer?&mdash;Hell's a-burning,
burning, burning; the Devil, prowling,
runs about."</p>

<h3>"A PAGAN POEM," FOR ORCHESTRA AND PIANO:
Op. 14</h3>

<p>This tone-poem was written originally (in 1901)
for a small combination of instruments,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> and was
intended for performance as chamber-music. It
was afterwards arranged for two pianos and three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
trumpets, and was performed in private in this form.
In 1905-6 the work was recast in its present shape&mdash;for
orchestra with piano. Its inspiration is derived
from the Eighth Eclogue of Virgil, the subject
of which consists of two love-songs, placed in the
mouths of Damon and Alphesib&#339;us. The poetic
basis of Loeffler's music is found in the second of
these love-songs. A Thessalian girl has resorted to
magic incantations in the hope that she may bring
back to her cottage her truant lover Daphnis.
The passage which inspired the mood of the music,
and which is quoted as a preface to the score, is
as follows (beginning, in the original, at the line
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Effer aquam, et molli cinge hæc altaria vitta</i>):</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>
<p>"Fetch water forth, and twine the altars here with the
soft fillet, and burn resinous twigs and make frankincense,
that I may try by magic rites to turn my lover's sense from
sanity; nothing is wanting now but the songs.</p>

<p>"<em>Draw from the city, my songs, draw Daphnis home.</em></p>

<p>"Songs have might, even, to draw down the moon from
heaven; with songs Circe transformed the crew of Ulysses;
by singing, the cold snake is burst asunder in the meadows.</p>

<p>"<em>Draw from the city, my songs, draw Daphnis home.</em></p>

<p>"Threefold first I twine about thee these diverse triple-hued
threads, and thrice round these altars I draw thine
image: an odd number is god's delight.</p>

<p>"<em>Draw from the city, my songs, draw Daphnis home.</em></p>

<p>"Tie the threefold colors in three knots, Amaryllis, but
tie them; and say, 'I tie Venus's bands.'</p>

<p>"<em>Draw from the city, my songs, draw Daphnis home.</em></p>

<p>"As this clay stiffens and as this wax softens in one and
the self-same fire, so let Daphnis do for love of me. Sprinkle
barley-meal, and kindle the brittle bay-twigs with bitumen.
Cruel Daphnis burns me; I burn this bay at Daphnis.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>
<p>"<em>Draw from the city, my songs, draw Daphnis home.</em></p>

<p>"So may Daphnis love, as when the heifer, weary with
seeking the steer through woodland and high grove, sinks
on the green sedge by a water-brook, in misery, and recks
not to retire before the falling night: so may love hold him,
nor may I care to heal.</p>

<p>"<em>Draw from the city, my songs, draw Daphnis home.</em></p>

<p>"This dress he wore of old the traitor left me, dear
pledges of himself; which now I even in the doorway, O
earth, commit to thee; for these pledges Daphnis is the
debt.</p>

<p>"<em>Draw from the city, my songs, draw Daphnis home.</em></p>

<p>"These herbs, and these poisons gathered in Pontus,
M&#339;ris himself gave me; in Pontus they grow thickest.
By their might I have often seen M&#339;ris become a wolf and
plunge into the forest, often seen him call up souls from
their deep graves and transplant the harvests to where
they were not sown.</p>

<p>"<em>Draw from the city, my songs, draw Daphnis home.</em></p>

<p>"Fetch ashes, Amaryllis, out-of-doors, and fling them
across thy head into the running brook; and look not back.
With these I will assail Daphnis: nothing cares he for
gods, nothing for songs.</p>

<p>"<em>Draw from the city, my songs, draw Daphnis home.</em></p>

<p>"See! the embers on the altar have caught with a flickering
flame, themselves, of their own accord, while I delay
to fetch them. Be it for good! something there is for sure;
and Hylax barks in the doorway. May we believe? or do
lovers fashion dreams of their own?</p>

<p>"<em>Forbear: from the city&mdash;forbear now, my songs&mdash;Daphnis
comes.</em>"<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The refrain&mdash;<em>Ducite ab urbe domum, mea carmina,
ducite Daphnim</em>&mdash;is intoned by three trumpets
behind the scenes.</p>

virtually obsolete family of viols. Its characteristic feature is
a supplementary set of strings, passing beneath the fingerboard
and through holes drilled in the lower part of the bridge,
which vibrate sympathetically with the strings actually engaged
by the bow. The tone produced is of a singularly rich
and beautiful quality. Until Loeffler wrote for it in <cite>La Mort

was by Meyerbeer in his opera <cite>Les Huguenots</cite>, where it is
employed in the accompaniment to <em>Raoul's</em> air in the first act,

1861; now living there and in Peterboro, N. H.</em>)</p>


<h3 class="nobreak">"LANCELOT AND ELAINE," SYMPHONIC POEM: Op. 25</h3>

<p>This symphonic poem was composed at Wiesbaden
in 1886. The published score contains
no indication of the specific moods, scenes, or incidents
which gave rise to the music; there is merely
the brief line: "After Tennyson," printed beneath
the title. Yet it is known that MacDowell conceived
his music to correspond, point by point,
with certain definite happenings in the story of
Lancelot and the Lily Maid of Astolat, as narrated
by Tennyson; and this correspondence between the
poem and the music it is possible to indicate here
in some detail.</p>

<p>These are the incidents which are successively
illustrated in the music:</p>

<h3>TWO FRAGMENTS (AFTER THE "SONG OF ROLAND"): Op. 30</h3>

<div class="indent6 spaceb">
<ol>
<li><small>THE SARACENS</small> (<em>Die Sarazenen</em>)</li>
<li><small>THE LOVELY ALDÂ</small> (<em>Die schöne Aldâ</em>)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>MacDowell, while living in Wiesbaden, Germany
(from 1885 to 1888), projected a symphony on the
subject of the Song of Roland, and a portion of it
was composed; but the plan was afterwards abandoned,
and the music which was to have formed
part of the symphony was published, in 1891, in the
form of two short tone-poems founded upon episodes
in the poem, and entitled: <cite>Die Sarazenen</cite>; <em>Die
schöne Aldâ: Zwei Fragmente (nach dem Rolandslied)
für grosses Orchester</em>. MacDowell has quoted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
on the fly-leaf of the score those portions of the
poem from which the conception of his music sprang.</p>

<p>"The Saracens," a tempestuous <em>Allegretto feroce</em>,
is a sombre portrayal of the scene in which Ganelon
swears to commit treason against Roland, while the
Saracens feast amid the flaring of pagan fires and
the wailing of sinister music. It is based on these
lines from the Song (printed in the score in old
German):</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center3"><small>THE SARACENS</small></p>

<p class="small2">"With blasts of trumpets and amid festal and warlike
scenes, tumultuously rushed forward the heathen hordes
and all their high chiefs. Quoth Ganelon:  'I swear to
you that of Roland I shall make an end.'"<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second "fragment," "The Lovely Aldâ," an
<em>Andantino teneramente</em> of grave tenderness, depicts
the loveliness and the grieving of Aldâ, Roland's
wife.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
MacDowell uses as a preface lines
from the German version, which, in translation,
read thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center3"><small>THE LOVELY ALDÂ</small></p>

<p class="small2">"Then came forward the lovely Aldâ; graciously was
she received by the Emperor himself and all his court.
Spake she: 'Karl, consecrated sovereign, where is my
Roland? Bring back to me my hero, he to whom you
gave me as wife! Ah, what joy should I have in beholding
him once more!'"</p>

</div>

<h3>SUITE (No. 2), "INDIAN": Op. 48</h3>

<p>This suite, in five movements, was composed in
1891-92. It is MacDowell's last and most important
orchestral work. Its thematic material,
as he acknowledges in a prefatory note to the score,
is based upon melodies of the North American
Indians, with the exception of a few subsidiary
themes of his own invention. "If separate titles
for the different movements are desired," he says
in his note, "they should be arranged as follows
[I give them here together with the expression
marks at the head of each movement, which are
highly indicative of their character]:</p>

<p class="indentm">1. <small>"LEGEND"</small></p>
<p class="center">("<em>Not fast; with much dignity and character</em>")</p>

<p class="indentm">2. <small>"LOVE-SONG"</small></p>
<p class="center">("<em>Not fast; tenderly</em>")</p>

<p class="indentm">3. <small>"IN WAR TIME"</small></p>
<p class="center">("<em>With rough vigor, almost savagely</em>")</p>

<p class="indentm">4. <small>"DIRGE"</small></p>
<p class="center">("<em>Dirgelike, mournfully</em>")</p>

<p class="indentm">5. <small>"VILLAGE FESTIVAL"</small></p>
<p class="spaceb center">("<em>Swift and light</em>")</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>Although there is no reason to believe that
MacDowell has here based his music upon such a
detailed dramatic plan as underlies, for example, his
symphonic poem "Lancelot and Elaine" (see pages
191-194), it is evident that he was inspired by
moods and pictures the nature of which is sufficiently
indicated by the titles of the different movements.
It may be interesting to note that there
is authority for the statement that the principal
theme of the first movement ("Legend") was taken
from a harvest-song of the Iroquois Indians in New
York State; that for his second movement ("Love-Song")
the composer used a love-song of the Iowas;
that the dominant theme of "In War Time" is one
to which the Indians of the Atlantic coast attributed
a supernatural origin and character; that a
Kiowa theme (a woman's song of mourning for
her lost son) dominates the "Dirge"; and that
the chief melodic ideas of the last movement
are a war-song and a woman's dance of the Iroquois.</p>

<p>In this music, it has been said, MacDowell "has
caught and transfixed the essential character of his
subject: these are the sorrows and laments and rejoicings,
not of our own day and people, but of the
vanished life of an elemental and dying race: here
is the solitude of dark forests, of vast and windswept
prairies, and the sombreness and wildness
of one knows not what grim tragedies and romances
and festivities enacted in the shadow of a fading
past."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p class="small2">[MacDowell's three remaining works for orchestra&mdash;the
symphonic poem "Hamlet; Ophelia" (Op. 22),<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the
"Suite" (No. 1: Op. 42), and its supplement, "In October"&mdash;have
no programmes whatsoever. The suite is in
four movements, titled as follows: (1) "In a Haunted Forest"

(<cite>Sommer-Idylle</cite>); (3) "The Shepherdess' Song" (<cite>Gesang
der Hirten</cite>); (4) "Forest Spirits" (<cite>Waldgeister</cite>).  "In
October," the supplement, is in one movement. This
episode formed part of the original suite, but was not
published until several years after (the first four parts were
published in 1891; the supplement in 1893). Both are
included under the same opus number.]</p>

<h2>MENDELSSOHN</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy: born in Hamburg, February 3,
1809; died in Leipsic, November 4, 1847</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">OVERTURE, "A MIDSUMMER-NIGHTS DREAM": Op. 21</h3>

<p>Mendelssohn, knowing Shakespeare through
German translations by Schlegel and Tieck,
wrote in 1826 (he was then seventeen years old)
his overture to "A Midsummer-Night's Dream."
The music was begun July 7th, and finished August
6th. It was first written as a piano duet, and afterwards
scored for orchestra. Mendelssohn's incidental
music to Shakespeare's play was not composed
until seventeen years later. The following comments
by Mr. Frederick Niecks furnish an excellent
indication of the significance of the overture:
"Before our mind's eye," he writes, "are called up
Oberon and Titania as they meet in 'grove or green
by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen'; the
elves, who, when their king and queen quarrel,
creep into acorn-cups; ... Peaseblossom, Cobweb,
Moth, and Mustardseed; the knavish sprite Puck,
<em>alias</em> Robin Goodfellow, who delights in playing
merry pranks.... But there are other things in the
overture than fairies. There are Duke Theseus and
his betrothed, Queen Hippolyta, and their train;
the two pairs of lovers&mdash;Lysander and Hermia,
Demetrius and Helena; and those hempen homespuns,
the Athenian tradesmen&mdash;Quince, Snug,
Bottom, Flute, Snout, and Starveling.... But let
us see where the different <em>dramatis personæ</em> are to
be found in the overture.</p>

<p>"The sustained chords of the wind instruments
[which begin the work] are the magic formula that
opens to us the realm of fairyland. The busy,
tripping part of the first subject [violins and violas]
tells us of the fairies; the broader and dignified
part, of Duke Theseus and his following; the passionate
first part of the second subject [at first
wood-wind, then strings, later the full orchestra],
of the romantic lovers; and the clownish second
part, of the tradesmen, the braying reminding us of
Bottom's transformation into an ass. The development
is full of the vivacious bustle and play and
fun of the elves; ... the <em>pianissimo</em> passage towards
the end ... signifies the elves' blessing on the house
of the Duke. In conclusion we have once more
the magic formula [the four sustained chords of the
opening], which now dissolves the dream it had
before conjured up."</p>

HEBRIDES"]<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>: Op. 26</h3>

<p>Mendelssohn, visiting the Hebrides in 1829, was
deeply impressed with what he saw. "In order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to make you realize," he says in a letter written
August 7, 1829, "how extraordinarily the Hebrides
affected me, the following came into my mind
there"&mdash;then follows, in notation, a passage from
the overture. Later in the month he wrote from
Glasgow: "How much lies between then and now!
... Staffa&mdash;scenery, travels, people: Klingerman
[the friend who accompanied him] has described it
all, and you will excuse a short note, especially as
what I can best tell you is contained in the above
music." In September he wrote from London:
"'The Hebrides' story builds itself up gradually";
and early in the following year (January 21, 1832)
he wrote from Paris: "I cannot bring 'The Hebrides'
to a hearing here because I do not regard
it as finished in the form in which I originally
wrote it [the first version of the overture was
finished late in 1830]. The middle portion ...
is very stupid, and the whole working out smells
more of counterpoint than of blubber, sea-gulls, and
salt fish." His friend Klingermann wrote as follows
of the impressions produced by Fingal's Cave:
"We were put out in boats, and climbed, the hissing
sea close beside us, over the pillar stumps to the
celebrated Fingal's Cave. A greener roar of waters
surely never rushed into a stranger cavern&mdash;comparable,
on account of the many pillars, to the
inside of an immense organ, black and resounding,
lying there absolutely purposeless in its utter
loneliness, the wide, gray sea within and without."</p>

<p>It has been said of the music of this overture that,
in hearing it, "you will think of yourself in a ship,
gliding over rocking waves, about you a vast expanse
of sea and sky, light breezes blowing, the romantic
stories of the past coloring the sights that
one has seen." Wagner, on the strength of this
work, praised the composer as "a landscape painter
of the first order."</p>

<h3>OVERTURE, "BECALMED AT SEA AND PROSPEROUS
VOYAGE": Op. 27</h3>

<p>Mendelssohn's <cite>Meeresstille und glückliche Fahrt</cite><a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
was written in illustration of two short and contrasted
poems by Goethe, entitled <cite>Meeres Stille</cite>
and <cite>Glückliche Fahrt</cite> (published in 1796). They
have been translated into English prose as follows:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p class="center3"><small>"BECALMED AT SEA"</small></p>

<p>"A profound stillness rules in the water; the ocean rests
motionless; and the anxious mariner looks on a smooth
sea round about him. No breeze in any quarter! Fearful
quiet of death! Over the monstrous waste no billow
stirs."</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"PROSPEROUS VOYAGE"</small></p>

<p>"The fog has lifted, the sky is clear, and the Wind-god
looses the hesitant band. The winds sough, the mariner
looks alive. Haste! Haste! The billows divide, the far-off
grows near; already I see the land!"</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The overture was composed in 1828, and revised
five years later. The introduction (<em>Adagio</em>) pictures
the ominous calm, the deathlike quiet of the waters,
the vast and motionless expanse of windless
sea. The flute-calls which end this first section
have been interpreted as "the cry of some solitary
sea-bird," as "whistling for the wind," as a portrayal
of "dead silence and solitude." Then follows
(<em>Molto allegro vivace</em>) the picture of the sudden
and inspiriting change which comes with the
springing up of the breeze&mdash;the clearing of the sky,
the joyous resumption of the voyage, the exhilarated
spirits of the mariners. The conclusion suggests
the happy arrival in port, the salutes, the
dropping of the anchor.</p>

<h3>OVERTURE TO THE LEGEND OF THE LOVELY
MELUSINA: Op. 32</h3>

<p>We know, on the testimony of Mendelssohn himself,
that this overture, based on the ancient legend
of the fair being who was part woman and part
fish, was suggested to the composer by an opera on
the subject which he saw at Berlin in 1833. Under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
date of April 7, 1834, he wrote to his sister Fanny:
"You ask me which legend you are to read. How
many, then, are there? And how many, then, do
I know? And do you not know the story of the
lovely Melusina?... Or have you really never
heard of the beautiful fish? I have composed
this overture to an opera by Konradin Kreutzer
["Melusine," libretto by Fr. Grillparzer, music by
Kreutzer, produced at Berlin February 27, 1833]
which I heard last year about this time at the
Königsstadt Theatre.... Hähnel [the singer&mdash;Amalie
Hähnel&mdash;who took the part of <em>Melusine</em>] ...
was very charming, especially in one scene where
she presents herself as a mermaid and dresses her
hair; it was then that I conceived the idea of writing
an overture.... I took what pleased me of the
subject (and that is, precisely what coincides with
the legend). In short, the overture came into the
world, and this is its family history."</p>

<p>The <cite>Ouvertüre zum Märchen von der Schönen
Melusine</cite> was finished November 14, 1833. Schumann
wrote of it as follows in the <cite>Neue Zeitschrift
für Musik</cite>, after a performance in Leipsic: "To
understand it, no one needs to read the longspun,
although richly imaginative, tale of Tieck;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
it is enough to know that the charming Melusina was
violently in love with the handsome knight Lusignan,
and married him upon his promising that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
certain days in the year he would leave her alone.
One day the truth breaks upon Lusignan that
Melusina is a mermaid&mdash;half fish, half woman.
The material is variously worked up, in words as in
tones. But one must not here, any more than in
the overture to Shakespeare's 'Midsummer Night's
Dream,' wish to trace so coarse an historical thread
all through.... Always conceiving his subject poetically,
Mendelssohn here portrays only the characters
of the man and the woman, of the proud,
knightly Lusignan and the enticing, yielding Melusina;
but it is as if the watery waves came up
amid their embraces and overwhelmed and parted
them again. And this revives in every listener those
pleasant images by which the youthful fancy loves
to linger, those fables of the life deep down beneath
the watery abyss, full of shooting fishes with golden
scales, of pearls in open shells, of buried treasures,
which the sea has snatched from men, of emerald
castles towering one above another, etc. This, it
seems to us, is what distinguishes this overture from
the earlier ones: that it narrates these kind [<em>sic</em>]
of things quite in the manner of a story, and does
not experience them. Hence, at first sight, the surface
appears somewhat cold, dumb; but what a
life and interweaving there is down below is more
clearly expressed through music than through
words, for which reason the overture (we confess)
is far better than this description of it."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>It has been said that the music illustrates "the
loveliness and the loving nature of Melusina; the
hardness of her fate and the anxiety caused by it.
The waving motion [the flowing theme heard at
the beginning] is indicative of her grace, and at the
same time reminds us of the element with which she
was connected." A more energetic theme is said to
suggest Melusina's knightly consort; a third theme
(in the violins) is a love-motive; later there is a
return, <em>fortissimo</em>, of the energetic knightly theme
of the beginning. There is a development of these
themes; and "near the end we may recognize
[Melusina's] cries on being discovered by her husband.
The rest is like the vanishing of a beautiful
reality into a beautiful memory."</p>

<h3>SYMPHONY No. 3 ("SCOTCH"): Op. 56</h3>

<p class="indent6">1. <em>Andante con moto</em></p>
<p class="indent6 ileft5"><em>Allegro un poco agitato</em></p>
<p class="indent6">2. <em>Vivace non troppo</em></p>
<p class="indent6">3. <em>Adagio</em></p>
<p class="indent6">4. <em>Allegro vivacissimo</em></p>
<p class="indent6 ileft5 spaceb"><em>Allegro maestoso assai</em></p>

<p>To Mendelssohn's Scotch visit in the summer of
1829 may be traced this third symphony in A minor,
as well as the "Fingal's Cave" ["Hebrides"] overture
(see page 200-202). In a letter dated July
30, 1829, he wrote from Edinburgh: "We went, in
the deep twilight, to the Palace of Holyrood, where
Queen Mary lived and loved. There is a little room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
to be seen there, with a winding staircase leading
up to it. This the murderers ascended, and, finding
Rizzio, ... drew him out; about three chambers
away is a small corner where they killed him. The
chapel is roofless, grass and ivy grow abundantly
in it; and before the altar, now in ruins, Mary was
crowned Queen of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Everything about is
broken and mouldering, and the bright sky shines
in. I believe I found to-day in that old chapel the
beginning of my Scotch symphony."</p>

<p>The symphony was planned in 1831. In a letter
written from Rome in March of that year he says:
"From April 15th to May 15th is the heyday of the
year in Italy. Is it to be wondered at that I cannot
call up the misty Scotch mood?" The work
was not completed until more than a decade later&mdash;January
20, 1842.</p>

<p>The first movement has been said to record the
sombre impressions made upon the composer by
his visit to Holyrood. The second movement has
been described as "a picture of pastoral nature,
characterized by a continuous flow of rural gaiety,"
and as "the most wonderful compound of health
and life, heath and moor, blowing wind, screaming
eagles, bagpipes, fluttering tartans, and elastic
steps of racing Highlanders, all rounded off and
brought into one perfect picture." The third
movement (<em>Adagio</em>) has been characterized as "a
revery in which the composer meditates upon the
ancient state and grandeur of the country. Its
majestic strains might almost have been swept
from Ossian's harp." In the last movement "the
romantic sentiment disappears. In its place we
have the heroic expressed with astonishing force
and exuberant spirit." This movement has also
been called "the gathering of the clans."</p>

<h3>SYMPHONY No. 4 ("ITALIAN"): Op. 90</h3>

<div class="indent6 spaceb">
<ol>
<li><em>Allegro vivace</em></li>
<li><em>Andante con moto</em></li>
<li><em>Con moto moderato</em></li>
<li><em>Saltarello: Presto</em></li>
</ol>
</div>


<p>This symphony was begun during Mendelssohn's
sojourn in Italy (1830-31); it was finished in March,
1833. The following commentary by Ambros on
the characteristics of the different movements is
as sound and as interesting as any: "... That
Italian clearness of outline, that cheerful, ingenuous
enjoyment of abounding life without dream-like
reflection, is a fundamental feature of the A
major symphony. If it were not too hazardous,
one might say ... [that] there sounds in Mendelssohn's
symphony, not indeed the impression of
Rome, ... where, according to Jean Paul's expression,
the spirits of heroes, artists, and saints gaze
on man, seriously admonishing him,&mdash;but rather the
local tone of the environs of Monte Cavo in the
adjacent Albanian chain of mountains. Indeed,
we may readily imagine the youth Mendelssohn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
looking out, let us say, from Nemi or Genzano
across the rounded mirror of the sea upon the
splendid foliage of the wooded cliffs of the coast,
and how the motive of the first movement, loudly
exulting in the full joy of life, passes through his
soul, so that he has to sing it aloud.</p>

<p>"The <em>Andante</em> [generally known as the 'Pilgrim's
March'] has been thought by some to be in the
church style. 'The cowl,' according to an old
proverb, 'does not make the monk,' and just as
little does a continuous contrapuntal bass make a
piece of music into a contrapuntally conceived one.
We might perhaps say more appropriately that the
<em>Andante</em> tells a romance of the olden time, as it
were, in the style of Chronicles&mdash;only the poet's
eye occasionally betrays itself, sadly smiling. Being
once in the Albanian mountains, with our fancy,
perhaps we now recall the picturesque castle-embattlements
of Grotta Ferrata, and the old
devotional stations with the solemn mosaic pictures
of saints upon a gold ground.</p>

<p>"In the [third movement] the person of the tone-poet
advances more into the foreground: it is the
purest feeling of well-being, of calm, happy enjoyment,
that emanates from the gentle movement of
this melody, as if reciting to itself Rückert's glorious
words:</p>

<p class="small2">
"'Die Erd' ist schön genug den Himmel zu erwarten,<br />
Den Himmel zu vergessen nicht schön genug ihr Garten.'</p>

<p class="small2">
["'The earth is fair enough to make us hope for heaven,<br />
Her garden not so fair that heaven is lost to mind.']</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>"And these horns in the Trio,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> are they not as if, in
the midst of the Italian paradise, a truly German
yearning comes over him for the dear light green
of the woods of his home?</p>

<p>"But the Finale, the 'Saltarello,'<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> draws us
into the midst of the gay swirl of Southern life;
and the almost melancholy <em>ritardando</em><a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> towards the
close, does it not remind us, like a sigh of the tone-poet,
that amid all the magnificence he is, after all,
but a stranger, a wanderer that comes and goes?
Like Berlioz's 'Harold,' this symphony is therefore
a souvenir of Italian travel, a piece of Italy that the
tone-poet has brought away with him."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Mendelssohn witnessed the Carnival at Rome, and
this last movement was doubtless the result of his
impressions, which he recorded in a letter written
[from Rome] February 8, 1831: "On Saturday
all the world went to the Capitol to witness the
form of the Jews' supplications to be suffered to
remain in the Sacred City for another year, a request
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
which is refused at the foot of the hill, but,
after repeated entreaties, granted on the summit,
and the Ghetto is assigned to them. It was a tiresome
affair; we waited two hours, and, after all,
understood the oration of the Jews as little as the
answer of the Christians. I came down again in
very bad humor, and thought that the Carnival
had begun rather unpropitiously. So I arrived in
the Corso and was driving along, thinking no evil,
when I was suddenly assailed by a shower of sugar
comfits. I looked up; they had been flung by some
young ladies whom I had seen occasionally at balls,
but scarcely knew, and when, in my embarrassment,
I took off my hat to bow to them, the pelting began
in right earnest. Their carriage drove on, and in
the next was Miss T&mdash;&mdash;, a delicate young English-woman.
I tried to bow to her, but she pelted me,
too; so I became quite desperate, and, clutching the
confetti, I flung them back bravely. There were
swarms of my acquaintances, and my blue coat was
soon as white as that of a miller. The B&mdash;&mdash;s were
standing on a balcony, flinging confetti like hail
at my head; and thus pelting and pelted, amid a
thousand jests and jeers and the most extravagant
masks, the day ended with races."</p>

Mendelssohn himself referred to it as "The Hebrides," again as

<p class="spaceb center">(<em>Allegro</em>)</p>

<p>Raff, an astonishingly prolific composer, wrote
twelve symphonies,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> of which "In the Woods"
(<cite>Im Walde</cite>) is one of the two that have most conspicuously
survived the winnowing processes of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p><cite>Im Walde</cite> was composed at Wiesbaden in 1869.
The programmatic bases of its different movements
may be indicated as follows:</p>

<p class="spaceb center">I. <span class="smcap">In the Daytime</span><br />
<small>IMPRESSIONS AND SENSATIONS</small> (<em>Allegro</em>)</p>

<p>"The first movement represents in a general manner
the feelings of a lover of nature in the forest
on a summer day." The Introduction evokes the
spirit of the woods "with the nameless charm of
rustling branches and the glintings of sunlight."
The mood is developed at length in its musical expression;
the close "brings to its end this charming
picture of the quiet surprises of the woodland in an
autumn day."</p>


<p class="center3 spaceb">II. <span class="smcap">At Twilight</span><br />
(<em>a</em>) <small>REVERY</small> (<em>Largo</em>)</p>

<p>"After a short introduction [clarinet and horn],"
comments Mr. George P. Upton, "the <em>Largo</em> begins
with a beautiful and suggestive melody [strings]&mdash;the
revery of the dreamer." Later, "the theme
returns twice&mdash;the first time with heightened pastoral
effect, the second time in much the same manner
as when originally given out."</p>


<p class="spaceb center">(<em>b</em>) <small>DANCE OF DRYADS</small> (<em>Scherzo: Poco meno mosso</em>)</p>

<p>Flutes announce the principal theme. This "is
in reality a dance movement&mdash;the dance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Dryads&mdash;but before its close the Revery motive
of the <em>Largo</em> appears, and thus unifies the movement
and completes the picture of the dreamer and
his revery intruded upon by the dancing wood-nymphs."</p>


<p class="spaceb center">III. <span class="smcap">At Night</span><br />
<small>SILENT RUSTLING OF THE WOODS AT NIGHT. ENTRANCE AND EXIT OF THE WILD HUNT WITH FRAU HOLLE

<p>A mysterious <em>pianissimo</em> theme for 'cellos and

the forest night. The spectral approach of the Wild

following in the train of the unholy crew, is announced
by a strongly rhythmed theme in the
strings, clarinets, and bassoons. The hunt draws
near and passes in a tumultuous increasing and
diminishing uproar of the orchestra; the fury of
the chase dies away, and there is a sharply contrasted
tone-picture of the dawn; a suggestion of
the sunrise brings the end.</p>

"Lenore." The first two parts illustrate phases
of the experience of the two lovers which antedate
the beginning of the story told by the poem.</p>

<p>In Bürger's poem the maid Lenore laments the
absence of her lover William, who has gone to
war "on Prague's dread battle-field";</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p class="indentm small2">"Nor had he sent to tell<br />
If he were safe and well."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The war ends, yet still no tidings come from the
missing swain. Lenore, frenzied by doubt and
longing, utters blasphemies. But that night a
horse and rider draw up at the gate, and a knock
summons her to the door. It is William. He bids
her "bind her dress" and mount upon his horse
behind him,</p>

<p class="indentm small2 ileft8">"... for to-day I thee<br />
A hundred leagues must bear,<br />
My nuptial couch to share."</p>

<p>Lenore complies, though after some questioning,
and they make off through the moonlight. The
pace is wild and terrible. They pass a train of
mourners bearing a coffin to the grave, but at the
behest of the bewildering bridegroom the funeral
party leaves the body and joins in the mad ride.
The croaking of night birds is heard, and spectres
are seen dancing about a gibbet.</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"How all beneath the moonbeams flew,<br />
How flew it far and fast!<br />
How o'er their head the heavens blue<br />
And stars flew swiftly past!<br />
'Love, fear'st thou aught? The moon shines bright.<br />
Hurrah! The dead ride quick by night!<br />
Dost fear, my love, the dead?'<br />
'Ah! speak not of the dead!'"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>
<p>Finally, as day begins to break, they dash through
an iron gateway into a graveyard. Then Lenore
beholds a horrid transformation in her lover:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"The rider's jerkin, piece by piece,<br />
Like tinder falls asunder.<br />
Upon his head no lock of hair&mdash;<br />
A naked skull, all grisly bare;<br />
A skeleton, alas!<br />
With scythe and hour-glass."</p>

<p>The "snorting charger" vanishes in flame; dreadful
cries fill the air; in the moonlight grisly spirits are
seen dancing, and howling as they dance:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"For hear! for hear! though hearts should break,<br />
Blaspheme not, lest God's wrath thou wake!<br />
Thy body's knell we toll,<br />
May God preserve thy soul!"</p>

<p class="spaceb center"><small>PART I. HAPPINESS IN LOVE</small><br />
<em>Allegro</em><br />
<em>Andante quasi larghetto</em></p>

<p>The first movement of Raff's symphony ("Happiness
in Love") portrays the felicity of the lovers
before the departure of William for the wars.
"Tenderness and longing speak out," changing to
"anxiety and foreboding." "The second part of the
movement is a delightful representation of the discourse
of the lovers, in which it is not difficult to
imagine William listening to the anxious expressions
of Lenore and seeking to quiet her and allay her
apprehensions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p class="spaceb center"><small>PART II. PARTING</small><br />
<small>MARCH TEMPO</small>; <em>Agitato</em></p>

<p>"War has broken out, and the lover must take
his departure." As from a distance, the march is
heard, at first softly; it increases in volume and
emphasis, coming nearer and nearer. There is an
interruption (<em>Agitato</em>), "which graphically depicts
the parting of the lovers [an impassioned dialogue
between violins and 'cellos] and Lenore's grief and
despair." The march is resumed, gradually diminishes,
and dies away in the distance.</p>


<p class="spaceb center"><small>PART III. REUNITING IN DEATH</small><br />
<em>Allegro</em></p>

<p>This, as has been said, is the only portion of the
symphony which is explicitly derived from Bürger's
poem. I quote Mr. George P. Upton's spirited
commentary: "It opens with a plaintive theme ...
suggestive of Lenore mourning for her lover as she
wakes from troubled dreams. Then follows an intimation
of her fate in a brief phrase for the trombones.
The Trio<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> of the march tells the story of
her despair, for the army has returned without her
lover. Her blasphemy and the remonstrances of
her mother are clearly indicated. The recurrence of
the first theme lands up to a rhythmical figure for
the viola, representing the tramp of the steed bearing
the spectre bridegroom. The bell tinkles softly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and Lenore descends to meet her lover. Then the
'cellos take up the figure, retaining it to the close.
The terrible ride begins. The bassoons and oboes
carry on the dialogue between the spectre and
his bride. One after another the constantly intensified
and impetuous music pictures the scenes
of the ride, the 'cellos and other strings keeping
up their figure. A gloomy dirge tells us of the
funeral train, and a weird theme in triple time of the
spectres' dance about the gibbet, accompanied by
wild cries of the night birds. More and more furious
grows the ride until the graveyard is reached,
when, after a moment of silence following the transformation,
a chorale strain is heard, with a sad and
tender accompaniment. The wretched maiden has
at last found rest."</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"SADKO," A MUSICAL PICTURE: Op. 5</h3>

<p>Rimsky-Korsakoff, who as a young man
served as an officer in the Russian navy, has
in his music shown a peculiar aptitude for delineating
the moods and aspects of the sea. "Sadko,"
composed in 1867, and sometimes spoken of as
"the first Russian symphonic poem," is music of
the sea. It has this programme, which is prefaced
to the score:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="small2">"The ship bearing Sadko [a hero of Russian legend, or,
according to some, a historical character], a famous
gusli<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> player, is becalmed on the high sea. He is thrown
overboard by his fellow-travellers as a propitiatory offering
to the Sea King, who receives him in his domain, while
the ship sails on. There is a great company beneath the
waves, for the Sea King is celebrating the wedding of his
daughter to the Ocean. He compels Sadko to play on his
<em>gusli</em>, and they all dance to the music. Spectres appear;
the dance grows wilder and wilder; stormier and stormier
are the billows. Sadko breaks the strings of his instrument;
an end is put to the dancing, the sea grows calmer,
and it is soon dark and still in the ocean depths."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the music there is first (<em>Moderato assai</em>) a
suggestion of the quiet sea, the becalmed ship.
Following that, the picturesque intent of the music,
heard in the light of the programme, is easily
followed.</p>

<p>Antar was a famous Arabian warrior-poet of pre-Mohammedan
times. He lived in the sixth century,
and his eloquence and inspiration as a poet
were so revered that one of his poems, inscribed
upon deerskin, was hung up among the idols in the
Kaaba<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> at Mecca for the adoration of worshippers.
Rimsky-Korsakoff's symphony (first performed at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Magdeburg in 1881) is based on a tale by Sennkowsky
of which Antar is the hero. Its substance
is condensed in the following note, in French and
German, prefaced to the score:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p class="spaceb center">I<br />
[<em>Largo; allegro vivace</em>]</p>

<p>"Awful is the view of the desert of Sham;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> mighty in
their desolation are the ruins of Palmyra, the city raised
by the spirits of darkness. But Antar, the man of the
desert, braves them, and dwells serenely in the midst of
the scenes of destruction. Antar has forever forsaken the
company of mankind. He has sworn eternal hatred on
account of the evil they returned him for the good which
he intended.</p>

<p>"Suddenly a charming, graceful gazelle<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> appears. Antar
starts to pursue it. But a great noise seems pulsing
through the heavens, and the light of day is veiled by a
dense shadow. It is a giant bird that is giving chase to
the gazelle.</p>

<p>"Antar straightway changes his intent, and attacks the
monster, which gives a piercing cry and flies away. The
gazelle disappears at the same time, and Antar, left alone
in the midst of the ruins, soon goes to sleep while meditating
on the event that has happened.</p>

<p>"He sees himself transported to a splendid palace, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
a multitude of slaves hasten to serve him and to charm his
ear with their song. It is the abode of the Queen of
Palmyra&mdash;the fairy Gul-nazar. The gazelle that he has
saved from the talons of the spirit of darkness is none other
than the fairy herself. In gratitude Gul-nazar promises
Antar the three great joys of life, and, when he assents to
the proffered gift, the vision vanishes, and he awakes amid
the surrounding ruins."</p>

<p class="spaceb center">II<br />
[<em>Allegro</em>]</p>

<p>"The first joy granted by the Queen of Palmyra to
Antar is the delight of vengeance."</p>

<p class="spaceb center">III<br />
[<em>Allegro risoluto alla Marcia</em>]</p>

<p>"The second joy&mdash;the delight of power."</p>

<p class="spaceb center">IV<br />
[<em>Allegretto vivace; andante amoroso</em>]</p>

<p>"Antar has returned to the fallen remains of Palmyra.
The third and last gift granted by the fairy to Antar is
the joy of true love. Antar begs the fairy to take away
his life as soon as she perceives the least estrangement on
his side, and she promises to do his desire.</p>

<p>"After a long time of mutual bliss, the fairy perceives
one day that Antar is absent in spirit, and is gazing into
the distance. Straightway divining the reason, she passionately
embraces him. The fire of her love inflames
Antar, and his heart is consumed away.</p>

<p>"Their lips meet in a last kiss, and Antar dies in the arms
of the fairy."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The grave theme for violas and wood-wind which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
is heard in the opening <em>Largo</em>, and which recurs
throughout the symphony, has been called the
"Antar" motive; while the graceful motive for
flute and accompanying horns in the succeeding
<em>Allegro</em> section has been said to characterize the
transformed gazelle&mdash;the miraculously potent fairy
queen through whose love Antar finally meets his
end.</p>

<p>César Cui, to whom the score is dedicated, has
thus commented on the music:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"First Part: Antar is in the desert&mdash;he saves
a gazelle from a beast of prey. The gazelle is a
fay, who rewards her deliverer by granting him
three pleasures. The whole of this part, which begins
and ends with a picture of the desolate and
boundless desert, is worthy of the composer's magic
brush.</p>

<p>"Second Part: The pleasure of Vengeance&mdash;a
rugged, savage, unbridled <em>Allegro</em>, with crescendos
like the letting loose of furious winds.</p>

<p>"Third Part: The Pleasure of Power&mdash;an Oriental
march. A masterpiece of the finest and most
brilliant interpretation.</p>

<p>"Last Part: The Pleasure of Love, amid which
Antar expires&mdash;a delicate, poetic, delicious <em>Andante</em>...."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Alfred Bruneau speaks of the music's striking
depiction of the three primal human passions:
"These sentiments, passing severally through diverse
measures, tonalities, and rhythms, over which
hovers insistently the parent-phrase of Antar, are
the faithful reflections of our tormented, vague, and
mysterious souls."</p>

<h3>"SCHEHERAZADE," SYMPHONIC SUITE AFTER "A
THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT": Op. 35</h3>

<p>Prefixed to the score of this suite (published in
1889) is the following programme, printed in French
and Russian:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"The Sultan Schahriar, convinced of the faithlessness
of women, had sworn to put to death each of his wives
after the first night. But the Sultana Scheherazade saved
her life by diverting him with stories which she told him
during a thousand and one nights. The Sultan, conquered
by his curiosity, put off from day to day the execution
of his wife, and at last renounced entirely his
bloody vow.</p>

<p>"Many wonders were narrated to Schahriar by the
Sultana Scheherazade. For her stories the Sultana borrowed
the verses of poets and the words of folk-songs, and
she fitted together tales and adventures.</p>

<p class="indentm">"1. The Sea and Sindbad's Ship.</p>
<p class="indent6">2. The Tale of the Kalendar-Prince.</p>
<p class="indent6">3. The Young Prince and the Young Princess.</p>
<p class="indent6 spaceb">4. Festival at Bagdad. The Sea. The Ship is Wrecked<br />
<span style="padding-left: 1em; ">on a Rock Surmounted by a Bronze Warrior. Conclusion."</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>There is doubt as to Rimsky-Korsakoff's precise
intention in the programme of this suite. Which
one of Sindbad's voyages is described, which of the
three Kalendars is referred to, and what adventure
of what young prince and princess, the composer
leaves to his hearers to decide. Moreover, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
event mentioned in the last number of the suite&mdash;the
wrecking of the ship upon a rock surmounted
by a warrior of brass (not "bronze")&mdash;occurs in
the story of the third Kalendar, while the wreck
of Sindbad's ship occurred under different circumstances.
The truth seems to be that Rimsky-Korsakoff
has aimed at translating into music the
spirit and atmosphere which unifies the various
stories, and has not troubled himself about the accuracy
or the consistency of his paraphrase. Like
Scheherazade herself, he has strung together, without
regard for continuity or coherence, whatever
incidents and fragments suited his purpose. Thus
his music is to be taken as a gloss on the tales as
a whole&mdash;on their general and underlying mood,
their color, their imaginative essence.</p>

<p class="center3">I. <small>THE SEA AND SINDBAD'S SHIP</small></p>

<p>The first theme of this movement, heard at the
opening, has been identified both as the motive of
the Sea and of Sindbad. Later we hear (solo
violin, with harp chords) the motive of Scheherazade.
An undulating <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">arpeggio</i> figure has been
called the Wave motive, and a theme first sung by
the solo flute that of the Ship. The Sea motive
forms a climax of the full orchestra. There is a
tranquil close.</p>

<p class="center3">II. <small>THE TALE OF THE KALENDAR-PRINCE</small></p>

<p>After an introductory passage, we hear the
Scheherazade theme on a solo violin with harp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
accompaniment, followed by a theme, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">quasi recitando</i>,
for solo bassoon, which seems here to have
the rôle of narrator. There is an intermezzo of
Oriental character. The end is spirited.</p>

<p class="center3">III. <small>THE YOUNG PRINCE AND THE YOUNG
PRINCESS</small></p>

<p>"Some think from the similarity of the two
themes typical of prince and princess that the composer
had in mind the adventures of Kamar al-Zaman
(Moon of the age) and the Princess Budur
(Full moon)." This movement is idyllic, a romanza
evolved out of two themes of folk-song character.</p>

<p class="center3">IV. <small>FESTIVAL AT BAGDAD. THE SEA.<br />
 THE SHIP IS WRECKED ON A ROCK SURMOUNTED BY A BRONZE WARRIOR</small></p>

<p>The motive of the Sea begins the movement;
the Scheherazade theme follows; then (<em>Allegro
molto e frenetico</em>) begins a brilliant depiction of the
revels at Bagdad. Then, abruptly, we are transferred
to a scene on shipboard. "We seem to
plunge into the broad movement of the surging sea,
straight on to the fateful event." While the jollification
is at its height the ship strikes the dreadful
rock. "The trombones roar out the Sea motive
against the billowy Wave motive in the strings.... The
storm dies.... There is a quiet ending with
development on the Sea and Wave motives. The
tales are told. Scheherazade, the narrator, who
lived with Shahriar 'in all pleasance and solace
of life and its delights till there took them the
Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies,
the Desolater of dwelling-places and the Garnerer
of graveyards, and they were translated to the
ruth of Almighty Allah,' fades away with the vision
and the final note of her violin."</p>

<h3>"A NIGHT ON MOUNT TRIGLAV": THIRD ACT OF
THE OPERA-BALLET "MLADA" (CONCERT
ARRANGEMENT FOR ORCHESTRA)<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></h3>

<p>In 1872 Rimsky-Korsakoff, César Cui, Modest
Moussorgsky, and Alexander Borodine (who, with
Mily Balakireff, were the famous coterie who
founded the "neo-Russian" school forty years ago)
<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
wrote each the music of an act to an opera libretto
by Gedeonoff, their chief of the Imperial Theatres,
who had ordered the work. This composite opera
was never produced, but Rimsky-Korsakoff made
use of his share of the music for the third act of his
opera-ballet "Mlada" (produced in 1893). The composer
afterwards made a concert arrangement of the
music of this act, and it was performed at Moscow
in 1903, under the direction of Wassily Safonoff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>The score of the work in its purely orchestral
form is prefaced by a descriptive programme, of
which the following is a translation:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="small2">"The stage is covered with thick clouds. Darkness.
The clouds disperse little by little, and finally disappear
completely. Falling stars. A clear, moonless night. A
gorge on Mount Triglav. Souls of the dead approach
floating, and begin a fantastic round (<em>Kolo</em>). The full
moon, which rises, lights up the gorge; in its rays appears
the wraith of the princess Mlada, making signs to Jaromir
to follow her. Lightly she glides above the rocks and
precipices. Jaromir follows her. The shades interrupt
the <em>Kolo</em>. Jaromir, in a wild burst of passion, seeks to
approach Mlada, who disappears. Jaromir pursues her.
The moon grows red. Subterranean thunder. Seized with
terror, the shades of the dead disappear. Night birds
wing their way across the stage. Evil spirits issue from
all the caverns and crevasses&mdash;demons, spectres, and
sorcerers come forth, and serpents and toads crawl out.
Revels and dances of the spirits of darkness. From the
midst of the infernal round, Chernobog arises, in the form
of a black stag, with his followers. He evokes the souls
of Jaromir and of Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt. Impenetrable
darkness. The stage is transformed into a splendid
Egyptian hall. Queen Cleopatra is reclining upon
a sumptuous couch of purple, surrounded by dancing-girls
and slaves. Dances of the slaves, the dancing-girls,
and Cleopatra. She seeks passionately to draw Jaromir
towards her; the soul of the latter grows animated; the
wraith of Mlada hides its face in its hands and weeps. A
cock crows. Suddenly everything vanishes. Deep night;
a peal of underground thunder. Quiet. The clouds successively
disperse. First gleam of dawn. The wooded
slope of Mount Triglav. Jaromir is sleeping. Nature
awakes; the leaves rustle and the birds twitter. A ray
of the rising sun falls on Jaromir. Full daylight."</p>

<p>Rimsky-Korsakoff composed, in 1895, an opera,
"Christmas Eve," based on a story by Gogol.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
It was produced at St. Petersburg December 10,
1895. Excerpts from it were afterwards made into
a suite by the composer. Mr. H. E. Krehbiel has
paraphrased Gogol's tale, as it has been utilized by
Rimsky-Korsakoff, with a clearness and concision
which could not well be bettered:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"[The story] is concerned with one of the adventures
of the hero, a young, handsome, herculean,
and stout-hearted blacksmith named Wakula,
in an effort to win the hand of a wilful and capricious
damsel named Oxana. She commands him to
bring her the <em>tscherewitschki</em> (embroidered slippers,
or little shoes) of the Empress Catherine the Great.
To understand how he achieved this feat it is
necessary to relate that his mother, Ssoloka, is a
mistress of the magic arts, and also a buxom dame,
who counts among her four lovers not only the father
of the whimsical Oxana, but the devil himself.
One day, the day before Christmas, her four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
lovers appear at her house in such rapid succession
that she is obliged to hide them in sacks, one after
another, to prevent discovery of the numerous
rivalry. In her haste two are put into one sack.
She has just disposed of the last when Wakula
comes home, and to him she gives the sacks (as
containing so much coal) to carry away to various
destinations. Wakula shoulders the three sacks
at once and is off. After depositing two of them
in the street, he discovers that he has trapped the
devil in the third, and under threat of baptizement
unless he consents, compels his satanic majesty to
transport him instanter to St. Petersburg, and help
him get the empress's slippers. Here the suite
begins, and, since most of it is of the descriptive
order, the rest of the tale may best be told with
hints intended to identify the scenes with the
music."</p>

<p class="center3"><small>TABLEAU I. INTRODUCTION: CHRISTMAS EVE</small></p>

<p>"The scene pictures Dikanka, a village in Little
Russia, on a clear, cold night (<em>Adagio</em>)."</p>

<p class="center3"><small>TABLEAU II. IN SPACE</small></p>

<p>"The stars group themselves upon the clouds
(<em>Andante</em>). The stars engage in games and dances
(Ballet). Mazurka, <em>Allegro assai</em>.... A procession
of comets (<em>Adagio</em>). A round dance, revolution of
the constellations about the pole (<em>Andante non
troppo</em>). A shower of meteors ( ... <em>Allegro</em>). Clouds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
descend and hide the stars. A wizard rides into
view, seated in a kettle, which he drives with an
oven-fork; after him, a rout of wizards, in pots, kettles
and bowls, carrying forks, frying-pans, tongs,
and pokers; witches astride of brooms. Dance of
the witches. Wakula rushes by upon the devil, in
the shape of a winged horse; wizards and witches
skurry after him (<em>Allegro assai</em>, with a dactyllic
figure to suggest the infernal ride). The lights of
St. Petersburg are seen (<em>Moderato</em>)."</p>

<p class="center3"><small>TABLEAU III. BRILLIANT BALL IN THE
IMPERIAL PALACE</small></p>

<p>"(Polonaise, <em>Allegro non troppo, alla Polacca</em>.)
The devil enters with Wakula (the dactyllic figure
is resumed). Darkness comes over the scene."</p>

<p class="center3"><small>TABLEAU IV. NIGHT, IN SPACE</small></p>

<p>"Glimpses of the setting moon are had through
rifts in the clouds (<em>Andante</em>). Flying through
the clouds, a multitude of empty pots and kettles,
brooms, forks, and other kitchen utensils (<em>Allegro</em>).
Wakula dashes past, in the opposite direction, upon
his devil-horse (<em>Allegro assai</em>). The clouds disperse
and vanish. The moon sets, and the morning
star (Venus) appears (<em>Moderato</em>). Dawn. Kolyada,
in a golden sledge, and Ovsen, on a boar
with golden bristles, appear with a train of light
elves who hymn them (<em>Andante</em>). Kolyada is an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
ancient Slavic sun goddess. In an old ceremony
she used to be represented by a maiden, clad in
white robes, who was driven from house to house in
the yuletide, while <em>kolyadki</em> (<em>i.e.</em>, Kolyada songs)
were sung by the youths and maidens who attended
her, and received gifts from the people in return for
their songs. The sun rises through the frosty mists,
and Dikanka becomes visible. Wakula is returned
with the shoes in time for early mass. The bells
of the village church are heard, and the people
singing the pious Christmas canticle."</p>

<h2>SAINT-SAËNS</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Camille Saint-Saëns: born in Paris, October 9, 1835; still
living there</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"OMPHALE'S SPINNING-WHEEL," SYMPHONIC POEM
No. 1: Op. 31</h3>

<p><cite>Le Rouet d'Omphale</cite>, composed in 1871,
was first a piano piece; it was afterwards made
over for orchestra and performed in Paris at a
<em>Concert Populaire</em> on April 14, 1872.</p>

<p>The following note, in French, prefaces the score:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small2">"The subject of this symphonic poem is feminine seductiveness,
the triumphant contest of weakness against
strength. The spinning-wheel is merely a pretext; it is
chosen simply for the sake of its rhythmical suggestion
and from the viewpoint of the general form of the piece."</p></blockquote>

<p>The note conveys the further slightly ironical
information that "those who are interested in the
study of details will see on page 19 (letter J) [of
the score] Hercules groaning in the bonds which
he cannot break [a laboring phrase in the 'cellos
and double-basses, repeated with cumulative expression],
and on page 32 (letter L) Omphale mocking
the hero's futile efforts [a theme sung by the
oboe]."</p>

<p>The music has been interpreted as falling naturally
into the three following sections: "(1) The
power of feminine allurement. Triumphant struggle
of weakness against strength; in fact, Omphale's
fascination of Hercules. (2) Hercules in bondage;
or, as the author has it, 'Hercules groaning under
the bonds which he cannot break.' (3) Omphale
deriding the vain efforts of the hero."</p>

<h3>"PHAËTON," SYMPHONIC POEM No. 2: Op. 39</h3>

<p><cite>Phaëton</cite> was produced in Paris, under Eduard
Colonne, at a concert at the <em>Théâtre du Châtelet</em>,
December 7, 1873. The score has this preface:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small2">"Phaëton has obtained leave to drive his father's, the
Sun's, chariot through the heavens. But his unskilful
hands lead the steeds astray. The flaming chariot, thrown
out of its course, approaches the terrestrial regions. The
whole universe is about to perish in flames, when Jupiter
strikes the rash Phaëton with his thunderbolt."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p></blockquote>


<p>The portentous drive is first pictured, the gallop
of the horses being indicated by an imitative figure
in the strings, wood-wind, and horns. A suave and
noble theme for the horns has been said to suggest
celestial visions glimpsed by the charioteer in the
course of his daring flight.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The furious rhythm of
the drive is heard again, increasing to a precipitate
pace. It is cut short by the Jovian thunderbolt
(kettle-drums, bass-drum, cymbals, tam-tam).
Then, as its reverberations die away, we hear again
the august harmonies of the second theme; there is
a reminiscence of the opening motive (of the ride),
and the music ends <em>ppp</em>.</p>

<h3>"DANCE OF DEATH" ["DANSE MACABRE"],
SYMPHONIC POEM No. 3: Op. 40</h3>

<p>This symphonic poem illustrates a fantastic poem
by Henri Cazalis, lines from which are prefixed to the
score. They are as follows (in a prose translation
made by Mr. W. F. Apthorp):</p>

<p class="indentm">
"Zig and Zig and Zig, Death plays in cadence,<br />
Beating time with his heel upon a tombstone;<br />
Death plays a dance-tune, Zig and Zig and Zig, on his fiddle.<br />
The winter wind blows, and the night is dark;<br />
Groans come from under the lindens;<br />
White skeletons flit across the gloom,<br />
Running and skipping in their capacious shrouds.<br />
Zig and Zig and Zig, capers every one;<br />
You hear the dancers' bones rattle.</p>

<hr class="dot2" />
<p class="indentm">
"But whist! Of a sudden they quit their dance;<br />
They rush off helter-skelter, the cock has crowed."</p>
<hr class="dot2" />

<p>A violin solo impersonates Death the fiddler,
while the rattling of the bones of the grewsome
dancers is delineated by the xylophone (wood-harmonica).
The uncanny dance increases in wildness
and abandon until it is cut short by the cock-crow (oboe).</p>

<h3>"THE YOUTH OF HERCULES," SYMPHONIC POEM
No. 4: Op. 50</h3>

<p><cite>La Jeunesse d'Hercule</cite>, first performed in Paris,
at a concert in the <em>Théâtre du Châtelet</em>, January 28,
1877, bears as a preface to the score the following
note (in French):</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p class="center3"><small>"LEGEND</small></p>

<p>"Mythology relates that Hercules, upon entering life,
saw two paths opening before him, the path of pleasure and
the path of virtue.</p>

<p>"Indifferent to the seductions of Nymphs and Bacchantes,
the hero chooses the path of struggles and combats,
at the end of which he perceives, through the flames
of the funeral pyre, the reward of immortality."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The music has been interpreted as a succession of
characterizations in this order: "(1) Irresolution
[<em>Andante sostenuto</em>: muted<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> violins; wood-wind,
strings, and wood]; (2) character of the path of
virtue [<em>Allegro moderato</em>: strings, without mutes,
in full harmony]; (3) seductiveness of the nymphs
[<em>Andantino</em>]; (4) allurements of the Bacchantes
[<em>Allegro</em>: flutes at first, later other wood-wind,
strings and wood, full orchestra]; (5) renewed
questionings [<em>Adagio</em>: strings, horns, wood-wind];
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
(6) choice of the path of virtue and consequent
struggles [<em>Andante sostenuto</em> and <em>Allegro animato</em>:
the theme of Virtue played by clarinet, afterwards
by oboe; later, the theme of pleasure heard in the
wood-wind against harp arpeggios]; (7) the funeral
pyre and immortality beyond [<em>Maestoso</em>: triumphant
supremacy of the theme of Virtue, in an orchestral
apotheosis]."</p>

<h2>SCHUMANN</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Robert Schumann: born in Zwickau, Saxony, June 8, 1810;
died in Endenich, near Bonn, July 29, 1856</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SYMPHONY No. 1, IN B-FLAT MAJOR ["SPRING"]:
Op. 38</h3>

<div class="indent6 spaceb">
<ol>
<li><em>Andante un poco maestoso; Allegro molto vivace</em></li>
<li><em>Larghetto</em></li>
<li><em>Scherzo: Molto vivace</em></li>
<li><em>Finale: Allegro animato e grazioso</em></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Although Schumann never publicly avowed
it, the inspiration for this symphony sprang
from a poem by Adolph Böttger (1815-1870), <cite>O
Geist der Wolke</cite>. The music was composed early
in 1841. In October of the following year Schumann
sent a portrait of himself to his friend Böttger,
accompanied by an inscription consisting of
the opening phrase of the symphony in notation,
and the words: "Beginning of a symphony inspired
by a poem of Adolph Böttger. To the poet, in remembrance
of Robert Schumann."</p>

<p>The verses of Böttger have been translated (in
prose) as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="small2">"Thou Spirit of the Cloud, murky and heavy, fliest
with menace over land and sea; thy gray veil covers in a
moment the clear eye of heaven; thy mist seethes up from
afar, and Night hides the Star of Love. Thou Spirit of the
Cloud, murky and damp, how thou hast frightened away
all my happiness, how thou dost call tears to my face and
shadows into the light of my soul! O turn, O turn thy
course&mdash;In the valley blooms the spring!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crux of this poem, and the key to an understanding
of the mood of Schumann's music, lies
in the concluding line:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"In the valley blooms the spring!"</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
("<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Im Thale blüht der Frühling auf!</i>")</p>

<p>Schumann himself spoke of this work as "a Spring
symphony," though it is not so titled on the score.
In a letter to Spohr he wrote (November 23, 1842):
"I composed the symphony ..., if I may say so,
under the impulse of that vernal ardor which sways
men even at the most advanced age, and seizes
them anew each year. I did not aim to portray or
to describe; but I do believe that the season in
which the symphony was conceived influenced its
character and its form and made it what it is."
He wrote also, on January 10, 1843, to Wilhelm
Taubert (who was to produce the symphony in
Berlin): "Could you imbue your orchestra with
something of the springtime mood, which I had
particularly in mind when I wrote the symphony in
February, 1841? The trumpet-call at the entrance
I should like to have sound as if it came from on
high like an awakening summons. By what follows
I might then suggest how on every side it
begins to grow green; how, perhaps, a butterfly
appears; and, by the Allegro, how gradually all
springtime things burst forth. These, it is true,
are fancies which occurred to me after I had finished
the work. I should like to say, however, concerning
the last movement, that I imagined it to
suggest the departure of spring, and I would have
it played in a manner not too frivolous." It will
be observed that Schumann makes no reference
whatever in these elucidations to what he has elsewhere
alleged as the particular source of his inspiration.</p>

<p>That the composer originally intended to give
descriptive titles to the different movements has
been declared with particularity, and these are said
to have been the superscriptions he planned to
use: (1) "Spring's Beginning" (<em>Frühlingsbeginn</em>);
(2) "Evening" (<em>Abend</em>); (3) "Merry Companions"
(<em>Frohe Gespielen</em>); (4) "Spring at the Full" (<em>Voller
Frühling</em>). The last of these would seem to conflict
with what Schumann himself wrote to Taubert
concerning the Finale.</p>

<h3>OVERTURE TO BYRON'S "MANFRED": Op. 115</h3>

<p>For Byron's dramatic poem, "Manfred," Schumann,
in 1848, wrote incidental music, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
first performed at Weimar under the direction of
Liszt on June 13, 1852, in connection with a version
of Byron's work prepared by Schumann for
the stage. The overture has, not unnaturally, survived
the rest of the music to the poem, and has
long been a familiar number in the concert-room.
It is, of all Schumann's works, says Mr. H. E.
Krehbiel, "the most profoundly introspective. It
is, as consistently as the prelude to Wagner's
'Tristan und Isolde,' an effort to delineate soul
states and struggles without the help of external
things. To understand it one must recall the
figure in Byron's poem&mdash;the strong man torn by
remorse, struggling with himself, bending supernatural
powers to his will, yearning for forgiveness
and death, tortured by a pitiless conscience, living
in a solitude which was solitude no more, 'but
peopled with the furies,' condemned by his own
sin to number</p>

<p class="indentm small2 ileft8">
'Ages&mdash;ages&mdash;<br />
Space and eternity&mdash;and consciousness,<br />
With the fierce thirst of death&mdash;and still unslaked!'</p>

<p>"The mood of the slow introduction, into which
the listener is plunged at once by the three syncopated
chords at the opening, is the mood of
Manfred weighed down by the reflection:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"'Old man! there is no power in holy men,<br />
Nor charm in prayer&mdash;nor purifying form<br />
Of penitence&mdash;nor outward look&mdash;nor fast&mdash;<br />
Nor agony&mdash;nor, greater than all these,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
"The innate tortures of that deep despair,<br />
Which is remorse without the fear of hell,<br />
But all in all sufficient to itself<br />
Would make a hell of heaven&mdash;can exorcise<br />
From out the unbounded spirit, the quick sense<br />
Of its own sins, wrongs, sufferance, and revenge<br />
Upon itself; there is no future pang<br />
Can deal that justice on the self-condemn'd<br />
He deals on his own soul.'"</p>

<p>"The sombreness," says Mr. Frederick Niecks,
"is nowhere relieved, although contrast to the dark
brooding and the surging agitation of despair is
obtained by the tender, longing, regretful recollection
of Astarte, the destroyed beloved one. And
when at last life ebbs away, we are reminded of
Manfred's dying words to the Abbot:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"'Tis over&mdash;my dull eyes can fix thee not;<br />
But all things swim around me, and the earth<br />
Heaves, as it were, beneath me....<br />
Old man! 'tis not so difficult to die.'</p>

<p>"From the first note to the last," says Mr. W. H.
Hadow, "it is as magnificent as an Alpine storm&mdash;sombre,
wild, impetuous, echoing from peak to peak
with the shock of thunderbolts and the clamor of
the driving wind."</p>

<p class="spaceb center"><small>"THE SWAN OF TUONELA"</small><br />
<small>"LEMMINKAINEN'S HOME-FARING"</small></p>

<p>Sibelius, sometime prior to February, 1906,
informed Mrs. Rosa Newmarch, the author
of the first authoritative study in English of the
Finnish composer, that he was writing a symphonic
poem in four parts under the general title "Lemminkainen,"

<p class="center3"><small>"THE SWAN OF TUONELA</small></p>

<p>"Tuonela was the name of the Finnish Hades.
Those wending their way to the final abode had to
traverse nine seas and one river&mdash;the equivalent
of the Styx&mdash;whereon sang and floated the sacred
swan&mdash;</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"'... the long-necked, graceful swimmer,<br />
Swimming in the black death-river,<br />
In the sacred stream and whirlpool.'"</p>

<p>The majestic, but intensely sad, swan melody is
heard as a solo for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cor anglais</i> [English horn], accompanied
at first by muted<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> strings and the soft
roll of drums. Now and then this melody is answered
by a phrase given to 'cello or viola, which
might be interpreted as the farewell sigh of some
soul passing to Tuonela. For many bars the brass
is silent, until suddenly the first horn (muted<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>)
echoes a few notes of the swan-melody with the
most poignant effect. Gradually the music works
up to a great climax, ... followed by a treble
<em>pianissimo</em>, the strings playing with the back of the
bow. To this accompaniment, which suggests the
faint-flapping pinions, the swan's final phrases are
sung. The strings return to the natural bowing,
and the work ends in one of the characteristic,
sighing phrases for 'cello.</p>

<p class="center3"><small>"LEMMINKAINEN'S HOME-FARING</small></p>

<p>"It was in pursuit of the Swan of Tuonela that
Lemminkainen, the reckless magician-hero of 'The
Kalevala,' lost his life. The capture of the sacred
bird was the last test of his courage and devotion
before he could win the bride of his heart. But
Nasshut, the crippled shepherd, who bore a grudge
against Lemminkainen, watched for his approach,
hurled at him a serpent snatched from the death-stream,
and flung him, mortally wounded, into the
'coal-black waters':</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"'There the blood-stained son of death-land<br />
There Tuoni's son and hero<br />
Cuts in pieces Lemminkainen.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Finnish hero shares the fate of Osiris. But
the fifteenth rune relates how his aged and faithful
mother implores 'the immortal blacksmith' Ilmarinen
to forge her a huge rake:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"'Lemminkainen's faithful mother<br />
Rakes the river of Tuoni,</p>

<hr class="dot2" />

<p class="indentm small2">
"To her belt in mud and water<br />
Deeper, deeper rakes the death-stream,<br />
Rakes the river's deepest caverns.'</p>

<p>"By untiring perseverance she recovers all the
missing members, knits them together by her incantations,
and finally restores her son to life.
When his thoughts revert to the woman he loves,
for whose sake he has accomplished a series of
heroic exploits, his mother persuades him in these
words:</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"'Let the swan swim on in safety<br />
In the whirlpool of Tuoni.<br />

("a word which signifies the dwelling of the heroes, 'sons
of Kaleva'&mdash;the Walhalla of Scandinavian mythology"), the
result of his researches and labors among the national folklore
of the Finns, in 1835. "The 'Kalevala' depicts the
ancient Finnish people as a race of free barbarians endowed
with many noble qualities, whose religion was a mild nature-worship,
demanding no blood sacrifices. The primitive inhabitants
of Finland&mdash;or Suomi, as it is still called in the
vernacular&mdash;believed that all objects in nature were inhabited
and ruled by invisible deities. They had more faith in the
<em>word</em> than in the <em>sword</em>; therefore the bard and the rune-singer&mdash;he
who possessed <em>the word of origin</em>&mdash;was more honored by
them than the warrior, the shedder of blood. For them the
word of origin lay concealed in the heart of nature. This tendency
to seek mind in the visible world is also characteristic
of all the literature and art of modern Finland. It has been
transmitted to a whole series of poets, whether, like Runeberg,
Franzen, and the elder Topelius, they sang in Swedish, or adopted
the Finnish idiom with Lönnrot and his successors. To this
imaginative people the making of songs was a part of existence&mdash;almost
a primal instinct. Of the three principal personages of
'The Kalevala,' Vainamoinen, the Finnish Orpheus, stands out
as the ideal hero of the race. Profound wisdom and the power
of magic song are his special attributes."&mdash;<small>ROSA NEWMARCH</small>.</p></div>

<h3 class="nobreak">"MY FATHERLAND," A CYCLE OF SIX SYMPHONIC
POEMS<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></h3>

<p>Smetana, an ardent nationalist and incorrigible
patriot, composed for the glorification of his
country a cycle of six symphonic poems under the
general title, "My Fatherland" (<cite>Má Vlast</cite>), dedicated
to the city of Prague. The titles and the
programmes (in outline) of the six parts of the
cycle are as follows:</p>

<p class="center3"><small>I. "VYSEHRAD"</small><br />
[1874]</p>

<p>A famous and historic Bohemian citadel at
Prague. The splendid life there in its past day of
glory and renown. The poet, at the sight of the
fortress, beholds visions of the past. "Vysehrad
rises up before his eyes in its former glory, crowned
with gold-decked shrines and the edifices of the
Premslide princes and kings, rich in warlike renown.
The brave knights assemble in the castle courts, to
the sound of cymbals and trumpets, for the festal
tourney; here are drawn up beneath the reflected
rays of the sun rows of warriors in rich, glittering
armor, ready for victorious contests.... Whilst
contemplating the past glory of the sublime dwelling
of princes, the poet sees also its downfall. Unchained
passion overthrows the mighty towers in
bitter strife, lays waste the glorious sanctuaries and
proud, princely halls. Instead of inspiring songs
and jubilant hymns, Vysehrad is become dumb, a
deserted monument of past glory; from its ruins
resounds the echo of the long-silent song of the
singer-prince Lumir through the mournful stillness!"<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>


<p class="center3"><small>II. "VLTAVA"</small><br />
[1874]</p>

<p>The river Moldau&mdash;the scenes through which the
course of the beloved river leads&mdash;beauties of nature,
historic edifices, deeds and achievements of
men, apparitions of nymphs and naiads.</p>

<p class="center3"><small>III. "SÁRKA"</small><br />
[1875]</p>

<p>Sárka, the "noblest of the Bohemian Amazons,"
was betrayed in love by one of the hated race of
men against whom the Amazons wage ceaseless
war. Craving vengeance, she has herself bound
to a tree, and, in simulation of distress, impels the
knight Ctirad, who is swayed by her beauty, to
release her. Ctirad and his warrior band, striking
camp for the night, fall asleep after long-continued
revels. Sárka then summons her companions by a
blast of her horn; they fall furiously upon the
sleeping warriors and put them to the sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p class="center3"><small>IV. "FROM BOHEMIA'S FIELDS AND GROVES"</small><br />
[1875]</p>

<p>A tonal celebration of natural beauties; music of
pastoral character.</p>

<p class="center3"><small>V. "TABOR"</small><br />
[1878]</p>

<p>The fortress of the Hussites.&mdash;A sonorous tribute
to the Taborites, their valor, and their heroic devotion
to their cause.</p>

<p class="center3"><small>VI. "BLANIK"</small><br />
[1879]</p>

<p>The name of the mountain on which are sleeping
in glorious death the Hussite warriors, awaiting
the resurrection which will restore them to renewed
service for the faith.</p>

Pfeiffer. In a letter dated October 9, 1832, Spohr
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
wrote:  "I have ... lately completed a grand instrumental
composition, a fourth symphony, which
differs greatly in form from the preceding ones. It
is a musical composition inspired by a poem of
Karl Pfeiffer's&mdash;<cite>Die Weihe der Töne</cite>&mdash;which must
be printed or recited aloud before it [the symphony]
is performed. In the very first part my task was to
construct a harmonious whole out of the sounds of
nature. This, as indeed the whole work, was a highly
attractive programme [Schumann afterwards described
it as 'eulogizing music with music']."</p>

<p>Pfeiffer's poem is as follows, divided in accordance
with its relation to the four movements of the
symphony:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p class="center3">[I. <small>RIGID SILENCE OF NATURE BEFORE THE CREATION

<p>"Solitary lay the fields in the flower-splendor of spring;
amid the silent forms wandered Man through the night,
following only his wild impulse, not the mild footprints
of the heart; Love found no tones, Nature no language.</p>

<p>"Then eternal Kindness wished to announce itself,
and breathed Sound into the breast of Man! And it let
Love find a language that penetrated to its heart and made
it happy. The nightingale greets him with tones of love,
the forest rustles forth harmonies to him, the Zephyr's
murmur fills his breast with longing, the brook's waves
whisper him to rest. Then, at the tones' sacred wafting,
the spirit, freed from every earthly bond, soars triumphant
to the heights of Heaven, and greets the fair fatherland of
dreams."</p>

<p class="center3">[II. <small>CRADLE SONG. DANCE. SERENADE</small>: <em>Andantino</em>]</p>

<p>"Holy tones, sounds of peace from the unknown world!
Ye are given to us as faithful companions 'mid life's joy
and sternness! At the child's first griefs on its faithful
mother's breast, ye already penetrate the little heart, and
turn the grief to gladness. Ye also invite all-puissantly
to the merry dance of Youth, and the dark cares are
hushed when the jubilant dance rings out. The clouds
have flown swiftly from the brow, the befogged spirit
grows serene, and, borne lightly on sounding billows, the
winged foot hovers on its way.</p>

<p>"In the secret husk of night ye sound from the youth's
mouth; ye bear tidings of the plenitude of his love to the
beloved one. Holy tones! Sounds of love! Your magic
power softens the loved heart's sternness, and the youth's
complaint is still."</p>

mêlée of battles, teaching the youth to despise life when
the trumpet calls to the fight. Cares and fear and dangers
vanish behind the triumphant tones, and the fiery glance
darts forward, to bind the brow with bloody laurels.</p>

<p>"But, when ye have begun boldly and wildly with the
call to fight and the battle-song, then, when the victory
is won, ye beckon backward with gentle sounds of peace.
Then ye bear, on the pinions of devotion, the heart aloft
to the eternal God, and the victors' joyous chorus teaches
us to give thanks to the God of Battles."</p>

<h2>STRAUSS</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Richard Strauss: born in Munich, June 11, 1864; now living
in Berlin</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"FROM ITALY," SYMPHONIC FANTASIA: Op. 16</h3>

<p class="indentm">1. <small>ON THE CAMPAGNA</small></p>
<p class="center">(<em>Andante</em>)</p>

<p class="indent6">2. <small>AMID ROME'S RUINS</small></p>
<p class="center">(<em>Allegro molto con brio</em>)</p>

<p class="indent6">3. <small>ON THE SHORE OF SORRENTO</small></p>
<p class="center">(<em>Andantino</em>)</p>

<p class="indent6">4. <small>NEAPOLITAN FOLK-LIFE</small></p>
<p class="spaceb center">(<em>Allegro molto</em>)</p>

<p>"<cite>Aus Italia</cite>," the first of Strauss's descriptive
works for orchestra, was composed in 1886,
a year in which the composer visited Rome and
Naples. The score is avowedly programmatic,
however, only to the extent of the titling of the
different movements, except that the second,
"Amid Rome's Ruins," bears this additional
superscription: "Fantastic Pictures of Vanished
Splendor; Feelings of Sadness and Grief in the
Midst of the Sunniest Present."</p>

<p>Of the first movement Mr. Vernon Blackburn
has remarked: "... the Campagna is absolutely
destitute of scenery, its tragic secret lying, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
most part, too deep even for the modern explorer;
its 'dim warm weather' is an attribute which exactly
describes its general aspect of loneliness
and locked quietude. These are the points which
Strauss makes apparent in his music, and proves
the constancy of that mood in the second portion
of his Fantasia, in which he only completes the
hidden tragedy of the Campagna&mdash;in the section
which he has entitled ['Amid Rome's Ruins']."</p>

<p>In the third movement, "On the Shore of
Sorrento," Mr. Hermann Kretzschmar finds (in
the middle portion) a picture of the sea ruffled by
the wind. "A boat appears, and in it a singer
sings a genuine native melody, sprung from the
noble sicilianos, which since the end of the seventeenth
century have passed over Europe, journeying
from the region near Sorrento."  "The strings,"
says another commentator, furnish "a rich background
for the sparkling flashes of melody which
emanate from the other instruments, the whole
being suggestive of a water-picture. The almost
constant shimmer in the strings might easily be
construed as a description of the restlessness of the
ocean, over which the melodies of the wood-wind
play like the glintings of sunlight."</p>

<p>In the last movement, "Neapolitan Folk-life,"
the famous song "Funiculi, Funicula," serves as
the principal theme, announced by violas and
'cellos. "The finale is brilliant, tumultuous, audacious."</p>

<p>"'My desolation doth begin to make a better
life.' Such," remarks Mr. Blackburn, "might
have been the motto upon which Strauss has built
the labor of this extraordinary work. He makes
you feel through every bar how completely his
musical spirit is oppressed by a sense of tragic
thought which, if anywhere, is surely appropriate
in the presence of the wreckage of that huge
civilization which reached the zenith of its glory
in the genius of Julius Cæsar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

</div>

<h3>"DON JUAN," TONE-POEM: Op. 20</h3>

<p>This work is usually placed first on the list of
Strauss's remarkable series of tone-poems; yet,
though it bears an earlier opus number, it was
actually preceded, in point of composition, by "Macbeth,"
op. 23, which was written in 1887, a year
earlier than "Don Juan."</p>

<p>The subject of this tone-poem is the "Don Juan"
of Nicolaus Lenau (1802-1850), and quotations
from Lenau's poem are prefixed to the score. They
are as follows:</p>

<div class="small2">

<p class="indent">

Fain would I, in the storm of stressful bliss,<br />
Expire upon the last one's lingering kiss!<br />

Wherever Beauty blooms, kneel down to each,<br />
And if for one brief moment, win delight!"</p>

<p class="indent">

Keep fresh for Beauty service and employ,<br />

And, if 'tis real, it nothing knows of rue!<br />
Each Beauty in the world is sole, unique:<br />
So must the Love be that would Beauty seek!<br />
So long as Youth lives on with pulse afire,<br />

<p class="center3"><small>DON JUAN</small> [<em>to Marcello, his friend</em>]</p>

<p class="indent">

<p>Lenau is said to have observed of his creation:
"My 'Don Juan' is no hot-blooded man eternally
pursuing women. It is the longing in him to find
a woman who is to him incarnate womanhood, and

to enjoy, in the one, all the women on earth, whom
he cannot as individuals possess. Because he does
not find her, although he reels from one to another,
at last Disgust seizes hold of him, and this Disgust
is the Devil that fetches him." Elaborate and inexorably
detailed commentaries have been written
on Strauss's tone-poem; yet this brief exposition by
Mr. Philip Hale is more truly illuminating than are
the exhaustive excursions of the German analysts:</p>

<p>"Lenau's hero is a man who seeks the sensual
ideal. He is constantly disappointed. He is repeatedly
disgusted with himself, men and women,
and the world; and when at last he fights a duel
with Don Pedro, the avenging son of the Grand
Commander, he throws away his sword and lets
his adversary kill him.</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
"'<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mein Todfeind ist in meine Faust gegeben;<br />
Doch dies auch langweilt, wie das ganze Leben.</i>'</p>


<p class="indent4 small2">"('My deadly foe is in my power; but this, too, bores me,
as does life itself.')"</p>

<p>Of the tragic end of the Don's insatiable experimenting&mdash;as
Strauss has turned it into music&mdash;he
says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Till the end the mood grows wilder and wilder.
There is no longer time for regret, and soon there
will be no time for longing. It is the Carnival, and
Don Juan drinks deep of wine and love.... Surrounded
by women, overcome by wine, he rages in
passion, and at last falls unconscious.... Gradually
he comes to his senses, the themes of the apparitions,
rhythmically disguised as in fantastic
dress, pass like sleep-chasings through his brain,
and then there is the motive of 'Disgust.' Some
find in the next episode the thought of the cemetery,
with Don Juan's reflections and his invitation to the
Statue. Here the jaded man finds solace in bitter
reflection. At the feast, surrounded by gay company,
there is a faint awakening of longing, but he
exclaims:</p>

<p class="indent2 small2">"'The fire of my blood has now burned out.'</p>

<p>"Then comes the duel, with the death scene.
The theme of 'Disgust' now dominates. There is
a tremendous orchestral crash; there is long and
eloquent silence. A <em>pianissimo</em> chord in A minor
is cut into by a piercingly dissonant trumpet F,
and then there is a last sigh, a mourning dissonance
and resolution (trombones) to E minor.</p>

<p class="indent4 ileft8">
"'Exhausted is the fuel,<br />
And on the hearth the cold is fiercely cruel.'"</p>

<h3>"MACBETH," TONE-POEM: Op. 23</h3>

<p><cite>Macbeth, Tondichtung für grosses Orchestrer (nach
Shakespeare's drama)</cite>, was composed in 1887. It
is actually, in date of composition, the first of
Strauss's orchestral tone-poems, though "Don Juan"
(see the preceding pages), composed in 1888, bears
an earlier opus number&mdash;20.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond the title and the acknowledgment&mdash;"after
Shakespeare's drama"&mdash;the score bears no
programme or explanation save the word "Macbeth"
printed over an imperious phrase for violins,
horn, and wood-wind near the beginning, and a
quotation from the play, in German, placed above
a passage on page 11 of the orchestral score, where
flutes and clarinets, <em>pianissimo</em>, give out, over
muted<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> horns and strings tremolo, a phrase whose
expression is marked <em>appassionata, molto rubato</em>.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
The quotation is from Lady Macbeth's speech in
Act I., Scene V.:</p>

<p class="indent small2 ileft8">
"Hie thee hither,<br />
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,<br />
And chastise with the valor of my tongue<br />
All that impedes thee from the golden round,<br />
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem<br />
To have thee crown'd withal."<br />
</p>

<p>German analysts have been, as in the case of all
of Strauss's needlessly and perversely recondite
programme-music, at pains to explore the music
of "Macbeth," and have written with lavish detail
in exposition of its significance. The end of it
all appears to be that in this tone-poem Strauss
has not attempted to illustrate the external events
of Shakespeare's tragedy, but has endeavored to
portray the character  of its protagonist, Macbeth
himself, and the struggle which goes on within his
soul.</p>

<h3>"DEATH AND TRANSFIGURATION," TONE-POEM: Op. 24</h3>

<p>Prefaced to the published score of <cite>Tod und
Verklärung</cite> (composed in 1889) is a poem by the
German musician Alexander Ritter,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> which was
written after the author had become acquainted
with Strauss's music, and under its inspiration.
That the verses were included by Strauss in the
printed score is sufficient evidence that he regards
them as an adequate interpretation of the emotional
plan underlying his music.</p>

<p>The subject of this tone-poem is the human soul
at grip with death, fronting imminent dissolution,
and reviewing feverishly the memorable phases of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
its past&mdash;childhood, youth, love, conflict, strife, aspiration,
despair&mdash;interrupted by desperate struggles
with the Destroyer. At the moment of death
there is the beginning of triumph&mdash;"deliverance
from the world, transfiguration...."</p>

<p>Ritter's poem, translated into English prose by
Mr. W. F. Apthorp, is as follows:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"In the necessitous little room, dimly lighted by only
a candle-end, lies the sick man on his bed. But just now
he has wrestled despairingly with Death. Now he has
sunk exhausted into sleep, and thou hearest only the soft
ticking of the clock on the wall in the room, whose awful
silence gives a foreboding of the nearness of death. Over
the sick man's pale features plays a sad smile. Dreams
he, on the boundary of life, of the golden time of childhood?</p>

<p>"But Death does not long grant sleep and dreams to his
victim. Cruelly he shakes him awake, and the fight
begins afresh. Will to live and power of Death! What
frightful wrestling! Neither bears off the victory, and
all is silent once more!</p>

<p>"Sunk back tired of battle, sleepless, as in fever-frenzy
the sick man now sees his life pass before his inner eye,
trait by trait and scene by scene. First the morning
red of childhood, shining bright in pure innocence! Then
the youth's saucier play-exerting and trying his strength&mdash;till
he ripens to the man's fight, and now burns with hot
lust after the higher prizes of life. The one high purpose
that has led him through life was to shape all he saw
transfigured into a still more transfigured form. Cold
and sneering, the world sets barrier upon barrier in the
way of his achievement. If he thinks himself near his
goal, a 'Halt!' thunders in his ear. 'Make the barrier
thy stirrup! Ever higher and onward go!' And so he
pushes forward, so he climbs, desists not from his sacred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
purpose. What he has ever sought with his heart's deepest
yearning, he still seeks in his death-sweat. Seeks&mdash;alas!
and finds it never. Whether he comprehends it more
clearly or that it grows upon him gradually, he can yet
never exhaust it, cannot complete it in his spirit. Then
clangs the last stroke of Death's iron hammer, breaks the
earthly body in twain, covers the eye with the night of
death.</p>

<p>"But from the heavenly spaces sounds mightily to greet
him what he yearningly sought for here: deliverance from
the world, transfiguration of the world."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The music, for purposes of elucidation, may be
divided into five (connected) sections:</p>

<p>We see the sick man lying exhausted upon his
bed in the little candle-lit room; he has just wrestled
wildly with Death. He smiles faintly, dreaming of
his youth.</p>

<p>Abruptly, Death renews the attack, and the dreadful
struggle is resumed. There is gradual exhaustion,
and once more a respite comes to the sufferer.</p>

<p>Now he is visited by dreams and hallucinations&mdash;memories
of youth, of young manhood and its
vicissitudes, of lusty conflict and passionate endeavor,
with illusory glimpses of future triumph.</p>

<p>But again Death attacks his victim. There is
a short and furious struggle, a sudden subsidence,
a mysterious and sinister gong-stroke; a portentous
silence signifies the final stilling of the
heart.</p>

<p>Then begins, gradually and gravely, the Transfiguration;
and through shimmering harps and
sonorous chantings of the brass is suggested the
final triumphant attainment of the soul released.</p>

<h3>"TILL EULENSPIEGEL'S MERRY PRANKS": Op. 28</h3>

<p>The full title of this work is: <em>Till Eulenspiegel's
lustige Streiche, nach alter Schelmenweise&mdash;in Rondoform&mdash;für
grosses Orchester gesetzt von Richard
Strauss</em>. Translated according to the most reasonable
authority, this means: "Till Eulenspiegel's
Merry Pranks, Set in the Old-Fashioned, Roughish
Manner&mdash;in the Form of a Rondo<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>&mdash;for Grand
Orchestra, by Richard Strauss." This sufficiently
formidable announcement introduced to the world
in 1895 (the year of its completion and publication)
a work which its author sought, after his usual
habit, to imbue with a kind of mystification the
point and savor of which it is a little difficult to
appreciate. When the "rondo" was produced at
Cologne, November 15, 1895, Dr. Franz Wüllner,
who conducted the performance, requested Strauss
to furnish an explanatory programme of the piece.
The composer declined. "It is impossible," he
said, "for me to furnish a programme to <cite>Eulenspiegel</cite>;
were I to put into words the thoughts which
its several incidents suggested to me, they would
seldom suffice, and might even give rise to offence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Let me leave it, therefore, to my hearers to crack
the hard nut which the Rogue has prepared for
them. By way of helping them to a better understanding,
it seems sufficient to point out the two
'Eulenspiegel' motives, which, in the most manifold
disguises, moods, and situations, pervade the
whole up to the catastrophe, when, after he has been
condemned to death, Till is strung up to the gibbet.
For the rest, let them guess at the musical joke
which a Rogue has offered them." The three motives
indicated by Strauss were the opening theme
of the introduction, the horn theme that follows
almost immediately, and the descending interval
that is said to be expressive of condemnation and
the scaffold.</p>

<p>Till Eulenspiegel, better known to English readers
as Tyll Owlglass, is the prank-playing vagabond
hero of a fifteenth-century German <cite>Volksbuch</cite> whose
authorship is attributed to Dr. Thomas Murner
(1475-1530). Till, according to Dr. Murner, was
born at Kneithlinger, Brunswick, in 1283, and died
of the plague at Mölln, near Lubeck, in 1350 or
1353, after wanderings through Germany, Italy,
and Poland. Till's exploits, the stories of which
are household words in Germany, consisted of
mischievous pranks and jests that he practised
without discrimination and, in some instances, with
a frank and joyous absence of delicate sentiment
which can best be described as Rabelaisean. In
Murner's tale, Till is sentenced to the gallows, but
escapes death at the last moment. Strauss, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
does not let his hero off, and permits him to
die on the scaffold.</p>

<p>Despite his disinclination to furnish an elucidation
of his music, Strauss has apparently given his
sanction to an analysis of the score prepared by
Mr. Wilhelm Klatte. As this is full, explicit, and
seemingly authoritative, it is quoted here, in part,
as follows, in an English translation attributed to
Mr. C. A. Barry:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A strong sense of German folk-feeling pervades
the whole work. The source from which the tone-poet
drew his inspiration is clearly indicated in the
introductory bars: <cite>Gemächlich</cite> [<em>Andante commodo</em>].
To some extent this stands for the 'once upon a
time' of the story-books. That what follows is not
to be treated in the pleasant and agreeable manner
of narrative poetry, but in a more sturdy fashion,
is at once made apparent by a characteristic bassoon
figure which breaks in upon the <em>piano</em> of the strings.
Of equal importance for the development of the
piece is the immediately following humorous horn
theme. Beginning quietly and gradually becoming
more lively, it is at first heard against a tremolo
of the divided violins and then again in the first
tempo, <em>Sehr lebhaft</em> [<em>Vivace</em>]. This theme, or at
least the kernel of it, is taken up in turn by oboes,
clarinets, violas, 'cellos, and bassoons, and is finally
brought by the full orchestra, except trumpets and
trombones, after a few bars <em>crescendo</em>, to a ...
<em>fortissimo</em>. The thematic material, according to the
main point, has now been fixed upon; the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">milieu</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
is given by which we are enabled to recognize the
pranks and droll tricks which the crafty schemer
is about to bring before our eyes, or, far rather,
before our ears.</p>

<p>"Here he is (clarinet phrase followed by chord for
wind instruments). He wanders through the land
as a thorough-going adventurer. His clothes are
tattered and torn: a queer, fragmentary version of
the 'Eulenspiegel' motive resounds from the horns....
The rogue, putting on his best manners, slyly
passes through the gate, and enters a certain city.
It is market-day; the women sit at their stalls and
prattle (flutes, oboes, and clarinets). Hop! Eulenspiegel
springs on his horse (indicated by rapid
triplets extending through three measures), gives
a smack of his whip, and rides into the midst of the
crowd. Clink, clash, clatter! A confused sound
of broken pots and pans, and the market-women
are put to flight. In haste the rascal rides away
(as is admirably illustrated by a <em>fortissimo</em> passage
for the trombones) and secures a safe retreat.</p>

<p>"This was his first merry prank; a second follows
immediately; <em>Gemächlich</em> [<em>Andante commodo</em>]. Eulenspiegel
has put on the vestments of a priest, and
assumes a very unctuous mien. Though posing as
a preacher of morals, the rogue peeps out from the
folds of his mantle (the 'Eulenspiegel' motive on
the clarinet points to the imposture). He fears
for the success of his scheme. A figure played by
muted<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> violins, horns, and trumpets makes it plain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
that he does not feel comfortable in his borrowed
plumes. But soon he makes up his mind. Away
with all scruples! He tears them off.</p>

<p>"Again the 'Eulenspiegel' theme is brought forward
in the previous lively tempo, but is now
subtly metamorphosed and chivalrously colored.
Eulenspiegel has become a Don Juan, and he waylays
pretty women. And one has bewitched him:
Eulenspiegel is in love! Hear how now, glowing
with love, the violins, clarinets, and flutes sing!
But in vain. His advances are received with
derision, and he goes away in a rage. How can
one treat him so slightingly? Is he not a splendid
fellow? Vengeance on the whole human race!
He gives vent to his rage (in a <em>fortissimo</em> of horns in
unison followed by a pause), and strange personages
suddenly draw near ('cellos). A troop of honest,
worthy Philistines! In an instant all his anger is
forgotten. But it is still his chief joy to make fun
of these lords and protectors of blameless decorum,
to mock them, as is apparent from the lively and
accentuated fragments of the theme, sounded at the
beginning by the horn, which are now heard first
from horns, violins, 'cellos, and then from trumpets,
oboes, and flutes. Now that Eulenspiegel has had
his joke, he goes away and leaves the professors
and doctors behind in thoughtful meditation.
Fragments of the typical theme of the Philistines
are here treated canonically.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> The wood-wind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
violins, and trumpets suddenly project the 'Eulenspiegel'
theme into their profound philosophy. It
is as though the transcendent rogue were making
faces at the bigwigs from a distance&mdash;again and
again&mdash;and then waggishly running away. This is
aptly characterized by a short episode in a hopping
2-4 rhythm, which, similarly with the first entrance
of the Hypocrisy theme previously used, is followed
by phantom-like tones from the wood-wind and
strings and then from trombones and horns. Has
our rogue still no foreboding?</p>

<p>"Interwoven with the very first theme, indicated
lightly by trumpets and English horn, a figure is
developed from the second introductory and fundamental
theme. It is first taken up by the clarinets;
it seems to express the fact that the arch-villain
has again got the upper-hand of Eulenspiegel, who
has fallen into his old manner of life.... A merry
jester, a born liar, Eulenspiegel goes wherever he
can succeed with a hoax. His insolence knows no
bounds. Alas! there is a sudden jolt to his wanton
humor. The drum rolls a hollow roll; the jailer
drags the rascally prisoner into the criminal court.
The verdict 'guilty' is thundered against the brazen-faced
knave. The 'Eulenspiegel' theme replies
calmly to the threatening chords of wind and
lower strings. Eulenspiegel lies. Again the threatening
tones resound; but Eulenspiegel does not confess
his guilt. On the contrary, he lies for the
third time. His jig is up. Fear seizes him. The
Hypocrisy motive is sounded piteously; the fatal
moment draws near; his hour has struck!... He
has danced in air. A last struggle (flutes), and his
soul takes flight.</p>

<p>"After sad, tremulous <em>pizzicati</em> of the strings, the
epilogue begins. At first it is almost identical with
the introductory measures, which are repeated in
full; then the most essential parts of the second
and third chief-theme passages appear, and finally
merge into [a] soft chord.... Eulenspiegel has become
a legendary character. The people tell their
tales about him: 'Once upon a time....' But that
he was a merry rogue and a real devil of a fellow
seems to be expressed by the final eight measures,
full orchestra, <em>fortissimo</em>."</p>

<h3>"THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA," TONE-POEM: Op. 30</h3>

<p><cite>Also sprach Zarathustra, Tondichtung (frei nach
Friedr. Nietzsche) für grosses Orchester</cite>, was begun
in February, finished in August, 1896. It is, as the
title implies, a tonal rendering of impressions derived
from <cite>Also sprach Zarathustra</cite> ("Thus Spake
Zarathustra"), the remarkable philosophico-romantic
fantasy of Friedrich Nietzsche.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Strauss's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
music is, he says, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">frei nach Nietzsche</i>; that is to say,
treated "freely" after Nietzsche. "I did not," he
has declared, "intend to write philosophical music
or portray Nietzsche's great work musically. I
meant to convey musically an idea of the development
of the human race from its origin, through
the various phases of development, religious as well
as scientific, up to Nietzsche's idea of the Over-man
(<em>Übermensch</em>)." A large order, one would say.
Whatever Strauss may have meant by "philosophical
music," he has certainly, whether he intended
to or not, composed a score which is utterly
and hopelessly incomprehensible unless one knows
what its relationship is, at every point, with
Nietzsche's book&mdash;a knowledge which Strauss has
considerately assisted by prefixing to each section
of the score an indication of the particular part
of the book to which the music refers. If this is
not translating philosophy into tones (or seeking
to do so), if it is not an endeavor to find musical
equivalents for various phases of a particular
philosophy, a particular chain of ideas, then we
shall have, as it seems, to discover a new significance
in very ordinary words. This is not the place to
discuss the <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> of the matter, or its aspect
from the stand-point of musical æsthetics; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
foregoing observations have been offered only for
the purpose of clearing the ground, and to prepare
the way for the statement which has now to
be made: that a comprehension of this particular
tone-poem, even with a knowledge of the score
and its annotations, is impossible without a pretty
complete understanding of Nietzsche's book and of
his outlook upon life and ideas&mdash;an understanding
which it is hardly feasible to attempt to communicate
here. It is at least possible, though, to
set forth certain of the essentials of his philosophical
stand-point and of the characteristics of his <cite>Zarathustra</cite>,
as a preparation for an acquaintance with
the tone-poem of Strauss; and this cannot be better
accomplished than by quoting from Mr. James Huneker's
vivid and sympathetic study of the man
and his views:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"What does Nietzsche teach? What is his central
doctrine, divested of its increments of anti-Semitism,
anti-Wagnerism, anti-Christianity, and
anti-everything-else? Simply a doctrine as old
as the first invertebrate organism which floated in
torrid seas beneath a blazing moon: Egoism, individualism,
personal freedom, self-hood. He is the
apostle of the <em>ego</em>.... He is a proclaimer of the
rank animalism of man. He believes in the body
and not in the soul of theology....</p>

<p>"It is in <cite>Also sprach Zarathustra</cite> that the genius
of Nietzsche is best studied. Like the Buddhistic
<em>Tripitaka</em>, it is a book of highly colored Oriental
aphorisms, interrupted by lofty lyric outbursts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
It is an ironic, enigmatic, rhetorical rhapsody, the
Third Part of a half-mad 'Faust.' In it may be seen
flowing all the currents of modern cultures and
philosophies, and, if it teaches anything at all, it
teaches the wisdom and beauty of air, sky, waters,
and earth, and of laughter, not Pantagruelian, but
'holy laughter.' The love of earth is preached in
rapturous accents. A Dionysian ecstasy anoints
the lips of this latter-day Sibyl on his tripod when
he speaks of earth. He is intoxicated with the
fulness of its joys. No gloomy monasticism, no
denial of the will to live, no futile thinking about
thinking&mdash;so despised by Goethe&mdash;no denial of
grand realities, may be found in the curriculum
of this Bacchantic philosopher. A pantheist, he
is also a poet and seer like William Blake, and
marvels at the symbol of nature, 'the living garment
of the Deity'&mdash;Nietzsche's deity, of course....
It is the history of his soul, as 'Leaves of
Grass' is Whitman's&mdash;there are some curious
parallelisms between these two subjective epics.
It is intimate, yet hints at universality; it contains
some of Amiel's introspection and some of Baudelaire's
morbidity&mdash;half-mad, yet exhorting, comforting;
Hamlet and John Bunyan."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Strauss's <cite>Also sprach Zarathustra</cite> was performed
in Boston in the year following its completion
(October 30, 1897), Mr. W. F. Apthorp
wrote for the programme notes of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra an analysis and exposition
of the work which for completeness and precision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
could not well be surpassed. I reproduce it, in
part, herewith:</p>


<blockquote>
<div class="small2">

<p>"On a fly-leaf of the score is printed the following excerpt
from Nietzsche's book:</p>

<p class="center3">"<small>'ZARATHUSTRA'S PREFACE'</small> (Friedrich Nietzsche).</p>

<p>"When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his
home and the sea of his home and went to the mountains.
Here he enjoyed his mind and his solitude, and did not
tire thereof for ten years. But at last his heart was
changed, and one morning he rose with the dawn, stood
before the sun, and spake thus to him:</p>

<p>"'Thou great star! What were thy happiness, if
thou hadst not him whom thou dost illumine! For ten
years hast thou come here up to my cave: thou wouldst
have had enough of thy light and of this road, without
me, my eagle, and my serpent.</p>

<p>"'But we awaited thee every morning, relieved thee
of thy superfluity, and blessed thee therefor.</p>

<p>"'See! I am tired of my wisdom, like the bee which
has gathered too much honey; I need hands that stretch
out.</p>

<p>"'I would make gifts and divide, till the wise among
men have once more grown glad of their folly, and the
poor, once more, of their riches. For this I must go down
to the depths: as thou dost of evenings, when thou goest
behind the sea and bringest light even to the lower world,
thou over-rich star!</p>

<p>"'Like thee, I must <em>go down</em>,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> as men call it, to them
to whom I would descend. So bless me, then, thou placid
eye, that canst see an over-great happiness without envy.</p>

<p>"'Bless thy beaker, which would fain overflow, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the water may flow out golden therefrom and carry the
reflection of thy ecstasy everywhere!</p>

<p>"'See! This beaker would fain become empty again,
and Zarathustra would fain become a man again.</p>

<p>"'&mdash;Thus began Zarathustra's downfall.'</p>
</div>

<p>"In Nietzsche's book, Zarathustra goes from
the mountains down to men and preaches:  'I
teach you the Over-man. Man is something that
must be overcome. What have ye done to overcome
him?... The Over-man is the meaning of the
Earth.... Man is a rope, made fast between the
Beast and the Over-man&mdash;a rope over an abyss.
A dangerous passing-over, a dangerous on-the-way,
a dangerous staying-behind, a dangerous shuddering
and standing-still. What is great in Man is that
he is a bridge and not a purpose: what can be loved
in Man is that he is a transition and a downfall.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>...
What good and evil is, that no one yet knows: unless
it be he who creates! But this one is he who
creates Man's goal, and gives the Earth its meaning:
he alone creates it that something shall be good
and evil.'</p>

<p>"The great problem Zarathustra tries to solve
in his speech is: to teach men the deification of Life;
all human values must be 'transvalued,' and therewith
a new order of the universe created, 'beyond
good and evil.' Zarathustra himself is this 'world
beyond,' he is the freest of the free, who descries
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
in all Becoming only a yearning after his own self
and teaching, which yearning alone can overcome
the 'simian' world and 'simian' Mankind, slaves
of traditional convention, and offer to Man&mdash;not the
Joy of Life, for there is no such thing, but&mdash;the
'Fulness of Life,' in the joy of the senses, in the
triumphant exuberance of vitality, in the pure,
lofty naturalness of the Antique&mdash;in short, in the
fusion of God, World, and Ego. This art of life of
Zarathustra's shall be shared by Mankind; herein
shall Zarathustra be dissolved in Mankind and 'go
down!' Thus are also to be explained the significant
closing words of the fourth chapter of 'Twilight
of the Idols'<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>: 'Mid-day: the moment of the
shortest shadow; the end of the longest error. The
culminating-point of Humanity: <em>Incipit Zarathustra</em>.'</p>

<p>"Taking the excerpt from 'Zarathustra's Preface,'
reprinted on the fly-leaf of his score, as his poetic
text, Strauss has illustrated it in his own way....
Perhaps it were best ... not to attempt a metaphysico-romantic
analysis of the work, but to leave
this to the listener's imagination, after putting
before him the composer's preface. It will be well,
however, to give some sub-captions which Strauss
has put at various points of the score.</p>

<p>"Just after the first great <em>fortissimo</em> outburst of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the full orchestra and organ on the chord of C
major,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> stands, '<small>OF THE DWELLERS IN THE REAR-WORLD</small>.'
These were fools and pietarians, who
sought the solution in <em>Religion</em>. Once Zarathustra,
too, cast his delusion beyond Humankind, like
all dwellers in the Rear-World. 'The World then
seemed to be the work of a suffering and tormented
God. The World then seemed to me a dream, a
God's poem.... I, too, once cast my delusion beyond
Humankind.... Ah, ye brothers, this God,
whom I created, was the work of a man, and&mdash;an
insanity, like all Gods.'</p>

<p>"Further on we find the sub-caption, '<small>OF THE
GREAT YEARNING</small>,' over a strenuous ascending passage
in the 'cellos and bassoons, answered by the
wood-wind. This refers to the following passage
in Nietzsche's book: 'Wouldst thou not weep, not
weep out thy purple despondency, then must thou
<em>sing</em>, O my soul!... <em>Sing with boisterous song</em>, till
all seas grow still, that they may listen to thy
yearning.... Already glowest thou and dreamest,
already drinkest thou thirstily at all deep-sounding
<em>Springs of Comfort</em>, already does thy despondency
find its rest in the beatitude of songs to come!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Over the expressive, pathetic <em>cantilena</em> in C minor
of the second violins, oboes, and horn, stands,
<small>'OF JOYS AND PASSIONS'</small>.</p>

<p>"Further on we come to the '<small>GRAVE-SONG</small>,' a
tenderly expressive <em>cantilena</em> in the oboe, over
the 'Yearning-motive' in the 'cellos and bassoons:
'Yonder is the island of graves, the silent one; yonder,
too, are the graves of my youth. Thither will
I carry an evergreen wreath of Life. Resolving
this in my heart, I journeyed across the sea. O
ye sights and apparitions of my youth! O all ye
love-glances, ye divine moments! How soon are ye
dead to me! I think of you to-day as of my dead
ones.... To kill me did they wring your necks, ye
song-birds of my hopes! Yea, at you, ye dearest
ones, did malice ever aim its shafts&mdash;to hit my
heart....'</p>

<p>"Over the fugued passage, beginning in the 'cellos
and double-basses, stands, '<small>OF SCIENCE</small>.' It
is to be noted, as a musical curiosity, that the
subject of this fugue contains all the diatonic and
chromatic degrees of the scale....</p>

<p>"Considerably further on, where a violent passage
in the strings (beginning in the 'cellos and
violas) soars up, ... stands, '<small>THE CONVALESCENT</small>.'...
'Let us kill the Spirit of Weight!...'</p>

<p>"So learn to laugh your way out of yourselves!
Uplift your hearts, ye good dancers, high! higher!
And forget not the good laughter! This crown to
the laughers, this rose-wreath crown: to you, my
brothers, do I dedicate this crown! <em>I have pronounced</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
<em>Laughter holy</em>; ye Higher Men, learn&mdash;to
laugh!... One must have Chaos in himself, to give
birth to a dancing star....' Then the '<small>DANCE-SONG</small>'
begins, ushered in by trills in the flutes and
clarinets.</p>

<p>"Much further on, after a <em>fortissimo</em> stroke of the
bell, comes '<small>THE SONG OF THE NIGHT-WANDERER</small>.'
In the later editions of his book Nietzsche gave the
corresponding chapter the title, 'Drunken Song.'
On the twelve strokes of the 'heavy, heavy humming-bell
(<em>Brummglocke</em>),' he wrote the following
lines:</p>

<p class="center3">
"'<small>ONE!</small><br />
"'O Man, take heed!'</p>

<p class="center3">
"<small>'TWO!</small><br />
"'What speaks the deep midnight?'</p>

<p class="center3">
"<small>'THREE!</small><br />
"'I have slept, I have slept&mdash;'</p>

<p class="center3">

<p class="center3">
"<small>'ELEVEN!</small><br />
"'Wants deep, deep eternity!'</p>

<p class="center3">
"<small>'TWELVE!'</small></p>

<p>"The composition ends mystically in two keys&mdash;in
B major in the high wood-wind and violins,
in C major in the basses <em>pizzicati</em>. Zarathustra's
downfall!"</p>

<h3>"DON QUIXOTE," FANTASTIC VARIATIONS ON A
THEME OF KNIGHTLY CHARACTER: Op. 35</h3>

<p>The full title of this work (composed in 1897) is:
<cite>Don Quixote (Introduzione, Tema con Variazioni,
e Finale): Fantastische Variationen über ein Thema
ritterlichen Characters</cite>. That is to say, it is in the
form of a theme with variations, the theme is
of "knightly character," and the variations are
"fantastic." From the programmatic point of
view, it is a series of tone-pictures in which are set
forth, upon a musical canvas of singular vividness,
the figures of Cervantes' Knight of the Rueful
Countenance and his squire Sancho Panza, and their
memorable adventures in quest of knightly glory.
The orchestral score contains no programme or
explanatory notes, save two superscriptions printed
above the dual portions of the theme, identifying
the first part with Don Quixote, the second part
with Sancho Panza; yet Strauss, with his inveterate
lack of consistency in such matters, has annotated
the pianoforte arrangement of his music with a
completeness which he has capriciously denied to
the orchestral score, placing at the head of each
variation a verbal clew to the particular adventure
which the music aims to describe. From these it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
is possible to follow its meaning in fairly ample
detail.</p>

<p>The music consists of an Introduction, a Theme,
ten variations, and a Finale, continuous throughout.
Each variation is concerned with some incident in
Cervantes' novel. A solo 'cello represents, or "enacts,"
Don Quixote; a solo viola, Sancho Panza.</p>

<p class="center3"><small>INTRODUCTION</small></p>

<p>Don Quixote is deep in the perusal of old romances
of errant chivalry. Grandiose and splendid
pictures pass through his mind and inflame his
imagination. He beholds Dulcinea&mdash;Dulcinea, the
ideal woman (oboe melody); he sees her beset by
giants and rescued by a knight. "His fantasy was
filled with those things that he read, of enchantments,
quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, wooings,
loves, tempests, and other impossible follies,"
and in the end, "through his little sleep and much
reading, he dried up his brains in such sort as
he lost wholly his judgment." The strain becomes
unbearable; the orchestra utters confused and insane
and wildly chaotic thoughts; until finally, "in
some terrible chords that give one the sensation of
an overstretched spring snapping violently," we realize
that the Knight is at last quite mad. He
has determined on a life of chivalry.</p>

<p class="center3"><small>THEME</small></p>

<p>The two-part theme is announced: Don Quixote
being limned by a phrase, pathetically grandiose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
for solo 'cello (<em>moderato</em>); Sancho Panza by a burly
and grotesquely comic theme first heard on the
tenor tuba and bass clarinet, but afterwards confined
to a solo viola.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Variation I</span><br />
<small>DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO PANZA SET FORTH</small></p>

<p>The knight and his squire set forth on their
quest of chivalric adventure, the Don inspired by
the thought of the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso (the
theme of the Ideal Woman). The sight of windmills
revolving in the breeze inspires his valor; he
charges them, and is overthrown by the sails.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Variation II</span><br />
<small>THE VICTORIOUS BATTLE WITH THE HOST OF THE GREAT
EMPEROR ALIFONFARON</small></p>

<p>Out of a cloud of dust (strings) Don Quixote perceives
the approach of an army. Sancho sees that
it is a flock of sheep (the muted<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> brass instruments
in the orchestra imitate their bleating), and seeks
to restrain the enthusiasm of his master. Don Quixote
charges valiantly and puts the enemy to rout.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Variation III</span><br />
<small>COLLOQUIES OF KNIGHT AND SQUIRE</small></p>

<p>Don Quixote and Sancho Panzo argue concerning
the reasonableness of a life of chivalry. The Don
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
waxes eloquent over the glory of a knightly career,
in an orchestral passage (developed out of his own
theme and that of Dulcinea) of striking fervor and
nobility. Sancho advocates the homely and attainable
things of reality; we hear a fragment of
his motive; but the Don silences him angrily.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Variation IV</span><br />
<small>THE ENCOUNTER WITH THE PILGRIMS</small></p>

<p>The knight and his squire fall in with a band of
pilgrims (a theme of ecclesiastical character for
the wind instruments). Don Quixote imagines
them to be villains and malefactors. He attacks
them and is worsted, falling senseless. He revives
slowly, and Sancho, relieved, lies down beside him
and sleeps.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Variation V</span><br />
<small>THE KNIGHT'S VIGIL BESIDE HIS ARMS</small></p>

<p>Don Quixote, following the knightly custom,
refrains from sleep and watches beside his arms
through the night. Ecstatically he perceives Dulcinea,
as in a vision (the theme of the Ideal Woman
is heard).</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Variation VI</span><br />
<small>THE MEETING WITH DULCINEA</small></p>

<p>Sancho Panza assures the Don that a certain
vulgar peasant girl whom they meet is his adored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Dulcinea (we hear the Ideal Woman theme, transformed
into a common and trivial tune&mdash;wood-wind
and tambourine). Don Quixote is incredulous.
He angrily ascribes the effect to some magical
agency.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Variation VII</span><br />
<small>THE RIDE THROUGH THE AIR</small></p>

<p>Sitting stationary with bandaged eyes on a
wooden horse, the knight and his squire believe
that they are being borne through the air. We
hear in the orchestra the whistling of the wind
(here enters the famous "wind-machine"); the
themes of the Don and of Sancho are giddily borne
aloft on the instrumental breeze. A long-held note
on the bassoon indicates their sudden stop, their
realization, as they look about them, that they
have not left the earth.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Variation VIII</span><br />
<small>THE JOURNEY IN THE ENCHANTED BOAT</small></p>

<p>The knight, perceiving an empty boat, and being
convinced that it is miraculously intended for his
use, embarks in it with his squire for the accomplishment
of some predestined deed of chivalry.
The orchestra plays a graceful barcarolle. The
boat upsets, but the two reach shore in safety.
They offer up thanks for their escape (a religious
passage for the wind instruments).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Variation IX</span><br />
<small>THE CONFLICT WITH THE TWO SORCERERS</small></p>

<p>Don Quixote meets two wayfarers whom he
takes to be the magicians whose sorcery has worked
him ill. They are merely a pair of inoffensive
monks, but the knight attacks them, with victorious
results.</p>


<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Variation X</span><br />
<small>THE COMBAT WITH THE KNIGHT OF THE SILVER MOON,<br />
AND THE OVERTHROW OF DON QUIXOTE</small></p>

<p>The bachelor Samson Carrasco, the "Knight of
the Silver Moon," one of Don Quixote's townsmen,
does battle with him for the sake of his own good
and to cure him of his delusions: "so to have him
in his own house, I thought upon this device."
The music portrays the contest between them,
which is thus described by Cervantes: "They both
of them set spurs to their horses, and the Knight
of the White Moon's being the swifter, met Don
Quixote ere he had run a quarter of his career so
forcibly (without touching him with his lance, for
it seemed he carried it aloft on purpose) that he
tumbled horse and man both to the ground, and
Don Quixote had a terrible fall; so he got straight
on the top of him; and, clapping his lance's point
upon his visor, said, 'You are vanquished, Knight,
and a dead man, if you confess not, according to
the conditions of our combat.' Don Quixote, all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
bruised and amazed, without heaving up his visor,
as if he had spoken out of a tomb, with a faint and
weak voice said, 'Dulcinea del Toboso is the fairest
woman in the world, and I the unfortunatest knight
on earth; and it is not fit that my weakness defraud
this truth; thrust your lance into me, Knight, and
kill me, since you have bereaved me of my honor.'
'Not so, truly,' quoth he of the White Moon; 'let the
fame of my Lady Dulcinea's beauty live in her
entireness; I am only contented that the grand
Don Quixote retire home for a year, or till such
time as I please, as we agreed before we began the
battle.' And Don Quixote answered that, so nothing
were required of him in prejudice of his Lady
Dulcinea, he would accomplish all the rest, like a
true and punctual knight."</p>

<p>Don Quixote, defeated, broken-hearted, his illusions
vanishing one by one, rides homeward with
his squire in profound dejection; and here the
orchestra evolves out of a pathetic variant of his
theme an eloquent and vivid commentary.</p>

<p class="center3"><span class="smcap">Finale</span><br />
<small>THE DEATH OF DON QUIXOTE</small></p>

<p>The knight, once more a sane and wise man,
his brain cleared of its mists, his reason restored,
lies dying peacefully in his bed. "They stood all
gazing one upon another, wondering at Don Quixote's
sound reasons, although they made some
doubt to believe them. One of the signs which
induced them to conjecture that he was near unto
death's door was that with such facility he was from
a stark fool become a wise man. For, to the words
already alleged, he added many more so significant,
so Christian-like, and so well couched, that without
doubt they confidently believed that Don Quixote
was become a right wise man.... Amidst the wailful
plaints and blubbering tears of the bystanders
he yielded up the ghost&mdash;that is to say, he
died."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The music which portrays his end is simple
and very peaceful. The chords which, at the
beginning, indicated his aberration, are now orderly,
tranquil, and composed.</p>

<h3>"A HERO'S LIFE" ["EIN HELDENLEBEN"], TONE-POEM:
Op. 40</h3>

<p><cite>Ein Heldenleben</cite> was completed in December,
1898. The score bears absolutely no indication of
its purport or significance save the title: we are
left to guess whether the "hero" whose life is
celebrated therein is an ideal hero or a figure of
history, of myth, of romance, or of private life.
Strauss is said to have observed, in response to a
question: "There is no need of a programme. It
is enough to know there is a hero fighting his
enemies." Yet the analysts have been busy with
this score, as with others by Strauss; and he has, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
least by implication, sanctioned their interpretations.</p>

<p>"A Hero's Life" is in six connected sections,
arranged and identified as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><small>THE HERO</small></li>
<li><small>THE HERO'S ADVERSARIES</small></li>
<li><small>THE HERO'S CONSORT</small></li>
<li><small>THE HERO'S BATTLE-FIELD</small></li>
<li><small>THE HERO'S WORKS OF PEACE</small></li>
<li><small>THE HERO'S RETIREMENT FROM THE WORLD, AND THE END OF HIS STRIVING</small></li>
</ol>

<p class="center3">I. <small>THE HERO</small></p>

<p>We hear first the theme of the Hero, a chivalric
and wide-arched phrase, of extraordinary breadth
and energy, announced <em>forte</em> by horns, viola, and
'cellos. Subsidiary themes follow, picturing various
aspects of his nature&mdash;his "pride, emotional nature,
iron will, richness of imagination," and so forth.
The main theme, weightily proclaimed by tenor
and bass tubas, four horns, double-basses, 'cellos,
and wood-wind, brings the first section to a thunderous
close.</p>

<p class="center3">II. <small>THE HERO'S ADVERSARIES</small></p>

<p>Herein are pictured the Hero's opponents and
detractors&mdash;an envious and malicious crew, rich
in all uncharitableness.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The wood-wind instruments&mdash;flutes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
oboes, English horn, clarinets&mdash;utter
shrill and snarling phrases: beside them, the spiteful
cackling of the wood-wind in the "<cite>Meistersinger</cite>"
overture is as the amorous murmuring
of doves. There is also an uncouth and sluggish
phrase for tenor and bass tubas, intended to picture
the malevolence of the dull-witted among the foe.
The theme of the Hero, in a sad and meditative
guise, pictures his dignified amazement, his pained
and sorrowful surprise that his adversaries should
so reveal the smallness and meanness and acrimony
of their natures. A poignant phrase, of "Parsifal"-like
color and profile (muted<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> strings) speaks of his
temporary disquietment&mdash;perhaps his doubt of his
own sublimity; but this is barely hinted at. His
dauntless courage reasserts itself, and the mocking
and contemptible horde are put, at least for the
time, to rout.</p>

<p class="center3">III. <small>THE HERO'S CONSORT</small></p>

<p>A solo violin, in a long and elaborate passage,
introduces the Hero's beloved. She is pictured at
first as capricious&mdash;a coquette; but the music grows
more tender, more gentle; the full orchestra enters;
the oboe sings an expressive melody; there are
rapturous and passionate phrases for the strings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
amid sweeping arpeggios in the harps, and the love
scene reaches its climax. The mocking voices of
the foe are heard remotely, like the distant croaking
of night birds through an ecstatic dream: they
are powerless to disturb the peace and felicity of
the lovers.</p>

<p class="center3">IV. <small>THE HERO'S BATTLE-FIELD</small></p>

<p>But now the call to battle sounds, and it may not
be ignored. Distant fanfares of trumpets summon
the Hero to the conflict. The orchestra becomes
a battle-field; the music is chaos&mdash;tumultuous, cataclysmic:
"it evokes the picture of countless and
waging hosts, of forests of waving spears and clashing
blades. The din, heat, and turmoil of conflict
are spread over all, and the ground piled high with
the slain." Through the dust and din we are reminded
of the inspiration of the beloved, which
urges on and enheartens the champion, whose
motive contests for supremacy with that of his
adversaries. A triumphant orchestral outburst on
the Hero's theme proclaims at last his victory.
Yet he rejoices alone&mdash;the world regards his conquest
with cold and cynical indifference.</p>

<p class="center3">V. <small>THE HERO'S WORKS OF PEACE</small></p>

<p>Now begins a celebration of the hero's victories
of peace, his spiritual evolution and achievements.
This section is introduced by a reminder of the uncouth
phrase for tenor and bass tuba heard in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
second division. The heroic and tender themes
of the preceding pages are recalled, and with them
are woven (a significant indication of the true subject
of the tone-poem) quotations of themes from
Strauss's earlier works. We hear, in surprising
and subtle combinations, reminiscences of "Don
Juan," "Thus Spake Zarathustra," "Death and
Transfiguration," "Don Quixote," "Till Eulenspiegel's
Merry Pranks," the music-drama "Guntram,"
"Macbeth," and the famous and lovely
song, <cite>Traum durch die Dämmerung</cite>. Industrious
commentators have discovered twenty-three of
these quotations.</p>

<p class="center3">VI. <small>THE HERO'S RETIREMENT FROM THE WORLD,
AND THE END OF HIS STRIVING</small></p>

<p>Again we hear, in the tubas, the uncouth and
cacophonous phrase which voices the dull contempt
of the benighted adversaries. Even the glorious
achievements of the Hero's brain, his spiritual conquests,
have won only envy and derision. The protagonist
rebels mightily; there are passionate and
tempestuous phrases, reminiscences of his theme,
in the strings, horns, and wood-wind. But his
mood quiets. Over a persistent tapping of the
kettle-drum, the English horn intones a gentler
version of his theme. An agitating memory of
the striving and conflict of the past disturbs, but
only for a moment, the serenity of his mood. We
are reminded of the consoling presence of the beloved
one. Peace descends upon the spirit of the
Hero. The close is majestic and benign.</p>

<h3>"DOMESTIC SYMPHONY": Op. 53</h3>

<p>In the course of an interview published in London
in 1902, Strauss made this announcement: "My
next tone-poem will illustrate 'a day in my family
life.' It will be partly lyrical, partly humorous&mdash;a
triple fugue, the three subjects representing papa,
mamma, and the baby." The <cite>Symphonia Domestica</cite>,
composed in 1903, was published in 1904. The
first performance anywhere was at Carnegie Hall,
New York, March 21, 1904.</p>

<p>The symphony, which bears this dedication:
<em>Meiner lieben Frau und unserm Jungen gewidmet</em>
("Dedicated to my dear Wife and our Boy"), is
in one movement and three subdivisions: (1) Introduction
and Scherzo; (2) Adagio; (3) Double
Fugue and Finale. The composer declined, at the
time of the first performance of the symphony, to
furnish any programme for the music.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
work was produced in Berlin (December 12, 1904),
under the direction of the composer, the programme
books contained this (presumably authorized) annotation
of the music:</p>

<p>A year later, in connection with the first performance
in England, an "official" description was published,
and it was intimated that this description
was "allowed" by the composer "to be made
public." It is therefore reproduced here, since
there is every reason to believe that it constitutes
an authentic interpretation of the music.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center3">"[<small>INTRODUCTION</small>]</p>

<p>"The symphony is concerned with three main
themes, that of the husband, that of the wife, and
that of the child. The husband theme is divided
into three sections, the first of which is marked
<em>gemächlich</em> ('easy-going,' or 'deliberate,' given out
by 'cellos), the second <em>sinnend</em> ('meditative,'<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> oboe,)
and the third <em>feurig</em> ('fiery,' violins). The first
section of the symphony, the Introduction, is
devoted to an exposition and treatment of the
chief themes, or groups of themes, its most striking
feature being the introduction of the child theme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
on the <em>oboe d'amore</em>, an instrument which has practically
fallen out of use.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The composer himself
has spoken of this theme as being of 'almost
Haydnesque simplicity.' On this follows a very
characteristic passage, which has been interpreted
as representing the child in its bath.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p class="center3">"[<small>SCHERZO</small>]</p>

<p>"The Scherzo bears the headings <em>Elternglück&mdash;Kindliche
Spiele</em> ('Parents' Happiness'&mdash;'The Child
at Play'). Its chief theme is the child theme in a
new rhythm. At its end the music suggestive of
the bath recurs, and the clock strikes seven. We
then come to the lullaby, where we have another
version of the child theme.</p>

<p class="center3">"[<small>ADAGIO</small>]</p>

<p>"The sub-headings of the Adagio are <em>Schaffen
und Schauen&mdash;Liebes-scene&mdash;Träume und Sorgen</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>('Doing and Thinking'&mdash;'Love Scene'&mdash;'Dreams
and Cares'). This elaborate section introduces no
new themes of any importance, and is really a
symphonic slow movement of great polyphonic
elaboration and superlatively rich orchestral color.
The gradual awakening of the family is next depicted
by a change in the character of the music,
which becomes more and more restless, the use of
rhythmical variants of previous themes being very
ingenious; and then there is another reference to
the bath music, and the glockenspiel<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> indicates
that it is 7 <small>A.M.</small></p>

<p class="center3">"[<small>FINALE</small>]</p>

<p>"In this way we reach the final Fugue. The
principal subject of this is also a new version of
the child theme. Its sub-title is <cite>Lustiger Streit&mdash;Fröhlicher
Beschluss</cite> ('Merry Argument'&mdash;'Happy
Conclusion'), the subject of the dispute between father
and mother being the future of the son. The
Fugue (the chief subject of which is another variant
of the child theme) is carried on with unflagging
spirit and humor and great variety of orchestration....
As the Fugue proceeds, the child theme gradually
grows more and more prominent, and finally
seems to dominate the whole score." ["The child
seems to have hurt himself in boisterous play," says
another commentator. "The mother cares for him,
and the father also has a soothing word."] "Some
new themes, all more or less akin to it, and all
in the nature of folk-tunes, are introduced. The
father and mother, however, soon assume their
former importance, and the whole ends with great
spirit and in the highest good-humor, with an emphatic
reassertion of the husband theme with which
it began, suggesting that the father had the last
word in the argument."</p>

(he married a niece of Wagner, an actress, Franziska
Wagner), met Strauss at Meiningen in 1885, during the latter's
term there as assistant conductor under Hans von Bülow.
The acquaintanceship was of vital consequence to Strauss.
"Before I knew Ritter," he himself has said, "I had been
brought up in a severely classical school. I had been nourished
exclusively on Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven; and then I
became acquainted with Mendelssohn, Chopin, Schumann,
and Brahms. It is only through Ritter that I came to understand
Liszt and Wagner.... Ritter was exceptionally well-read
in all the philosophers, ancient and modern, and a man of the
highest culture. His influence was in the nature of a storm-wind.
He urged me on to the development of the poetic, the
expressive, in music, as exemplified in the works of Liszt,
Wagner, and Berlioz."</p></div>

born at Röcken, near Lützen, Germany, October 15, 1844;
he died insane at Weimar, August 28, 1900. He was, at one
time, a close friend of Richard Wagner's and a passionate adherent
and champion of his cause in the days when Wagnerism
needed such devoted and effective advocacy as his. Later
he became estranged from the author of "Parsifal," and his
antagonism was as fervent as had been his partisanship. His
bitter and savage <cite>Der Fall Wagner</cite> (1888) is famous. <cite>Also
sprach Zarathustra</cite>, written in 1883-1885, was published in
1892. Nietzsche's "Zarathustra," it may not be superfluous
to add, has nothing whatever in common with the Zarathustra
(Zoroaster) of the Persians.</p></div>

(February 25, 1905), Mr. Ernest Newman, discussing the
stand-point of Strauss towards his works and the public, relieved
his mind as follows (it is well to reproduce his comment
here, since it may obviate some confusion in the thought of
the reader unacquainted with the history of Strauss's relation
to programme-music in general and his own in particular):
"It has been said very confidently that here Strauss has forsaken
programme-music and gone back to music of the absolute
order; it has also been said, with equal confidence,
that he has done nothing of the kind. Strauss himself has
behaved as foolishly over it as he might have been expected
to do after his previous exploits in the same line. He writes
a work like 'Till Eulenspiegel,' that is based from start to
finish on the most definite of episodes, and then goes through
the heavy farce of 'mystifying' his hearers by telling them he
prefers not to give them the clue to the episodes, but to leave
them to 'crack the nut' as best they can. All the while he is
giving clue after clue to his personal friends, till at length
sufficient information is gathered to reconstruct the story that
Strauss had worked upon; this gradually gets into all the
programme books, and then we are able to listen to the work
in the only way it can be listened to with any comprehension&mdash;with
a full knowledge of the programme. With each new
work of Strauss there is the same tomfoolery&mdash;one can use no
milder word to describe proceedings that no doubt have a
rude kind of German humor, but that strike other people as
more than a trifle silly. So it is now with the 'Symphonia
Domestica.'"</p></div>

stands a minor third lower in pitch than the treble oboe. It

it might be restored with advantage. Its use by Strauss is

<h2>TSCHAIKOWSKY</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Peter Iljitsch Tschaikowsky: born in Votinsk, in the government

St. Petersburg, November 6, 1893</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"ROMEO AND JULIET," OVERTURE-FANTASIE<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></h3>

<p>"Romeo and Juliet" ("overture-fantasie
after Shakespeare"), composed in 1869-70, is
the second of Tschaikowsky's programmatic works
for orchestra.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> There is no note of any kind attached
to the score; but according to responsible
interpreters the music is concerned with definite
aspects of Shakespeare's tragedy. At the start is
presented the figure of Friar Laurence (churchly
harmonies in the clarinets and bassoons); later, the
conflict of the opposing houses, expressed in a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>

tumultuous passage full of strife and fury. Then
follows the love scene, introducing two themes
of rich emotional suggestion. The first of these
themes&mdash;the rhapsodic and song-like phrase announced
by muted<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> violas and English horn&mdash;was
used by Tschaikowsky in the fragmentary "Duo
from 'Romeo and Juliet'" found among his papers
after his death, where it voices these words sung
by Romeo: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">O nuit d'extase, arrête toi, O nuit
d'amour, étends ton voile noir sur nous!</i> ("O linger,
night of ecstasy; O night of love, spread thy
dark veil over us!"). The second theme&mdash;the
lovely sequence of chords scored for muted and
divided violins&mdash;forms, in the duet, the accompaniment
to the impassioned dialogue of the enamoured
pair in the chamber scene.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Following
the love scene is a resumption of the stress and
conflict of the first part, against which the solemn
warning of Friar Laurence protests in vain. The
lovers are again evoked, with more passionate insistence
than before; there is a cumulative moment
of arresting intensity; then, after a brief
and portentous silence, a dolorous reminiscence of
Romeo's ecstatic song, now dirge-like and woful
(violins, 'cellos, bassoons; afterwards, declaimed
with greater breadth, in the strings, with accompaniment
of wood-wind, horns, and harp), brings
the music to a close.</p>

<h3>FANTASIA, "THE TEMPEST": Op. 18</h3>

<p>During a visit to St. Petersburg in the winter of
1872-73, Tschaikowsky begged his friend Vladimir
Stassov to suggest to him a subject for a symphonic
fantasia&mdash;something, he preferred, Shakespearian.
Stassov responded by sending Tschaikowsky a letter
proposing "The Tempest" as a theme, and
outlining, in elaborate and enthusiastic detail, the
poetic and dramatic plan which, he conceived,
should underlie the music. This scheme so appealed
to Tschaikowsky that he announced his
determination "to carry out every detail"; and,
to judge from his own programme affixed to the
score, he actually did so. Stassov's remarks, therefore,
serve as the best possible commentary on the
significance of Tschaikowsky's music. He wrote as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I ... rejoice in the prospect of your work,
which should prove a worthy pendant to your
'Romeo and Juliet' [see the preceding pages].
You ask whether it is necessary to introduce the
tempest. Most certainly. Undoubtedly, most undoubtedly.
Without it ... the entire programme
would fall through. I have carefully weighed every
incident, with all their <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em>, and it
would be a pity to upset the whole business. I
think the sea should be depicted twice&mdash;at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
opening and close of the work. In the introduction
I pictured it to myself as calm, until Prospero
works his spell and the storm begins. But I think
this storm should be different from all others [all
other orchestral storms], in that it breaks out <em>at
once</em> in all its fury, and does not, as generally
happens, work itself up to a climax by degrees.
I suggest this original treatment because this
particular tempest is brought about by enchantment,
and not, as in most operas, oratorios, and
symphonies, by natural agencies. When the storm
has abated, when its roaring, screeching, booming,
and raging have subsided, the Enchanted Island
appears in all its beauty, and, still more lovely, the
maiden Miranda, who flits like a sunbeam over the
island. Her conversation with Prospero, and immediately
afterwards with Ferdinand, who fascinates
her, and with whom she falls in love. The
love theme (<em>crescendo</em>) must resemble the expanding
and blooming of a flower; Shakespeare has thus
depicted her at the close of the first act, and I
think this would be something well suited to your
muse. Then I would suggest the appearance of
Caliban, the half-animal slave; and then Ariel,
whose motto you may find in Shakespeare's lyric
(at the end of the first act)&mdash;'Come unto these
yellow sands.' After Ariel, Ferdinand and Miranda
should reappear; this time in a phrase of
glowing passion. Then the imposing figure of
Prospero, who relinquishes his magic arts and takes
farewell of his past; and finally the sea, calm and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
peaceful, which washes the shores of the desert island,
while the happy inhabitants are borne away in
a ship to distant Italy."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How faithfully Tschaikowsky adhered to this
admirable plan is made evident by the following
programme, which, in Russian and French, prefixes
the score:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="small2">"The Sea. Ariel, spirit of the air, obedient to the will
of the magician Prospero, evokes a tempest. Wreck of
the ship which carries Ferdinand. The Enchanted Isle.
First timid stirring of love between Miranda and Ferdinand.
Ariel. Caliban. The love-lorn couple abandon
themselves to the triumphant sway of passion. Prospero
lays aside his magical power and quits the isle. The
Sea."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><cite>La Tempête</cite> was begun early in August, 1873,
and finished three months later. It is dedicated to
Stassov. The work was produced at a concert of
the Moscow Musical Society, December 19, 1873.
In November of the following year it was performed
in St. Petersburg. Stassov attended a rehearsal,
and wrote frankly to Tschaikowsky concerning the
music of which he was at least part creator:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I have just come from the rehearsal for Saturday's
concert. Your 'Tempest' was played for
the first time. Rimsky-Korsakoff and I sat alone
in the empty hall and overflowed with delight.</p>

<p>"Your 'Tempest' is fascinating! Unlike any other
work! The tempest itself is not remarkable
or new; Prospero, too, is nothing out of the way,
and at the close you have made a very common-place
cadenza, such as one might find in the finale
of an Italian opera&mdash;these are three blemishes.
But all the rest is a marvel of marvels! Caliban,
Ariel, the love scene&mdash;all belong to the highest creations
of art. In both love scenes, what passion,
what languor, what beauty! I know nothing to
compare with it. The wild, uncouth Caliban, the
wonderful flights of Ariel&mdash;these are creations of the
first order. In this scene the orchestration is enchanting.</p>

<p>"Rimsky and I send you our homage and heartiest
congratulations upon the completion of such a fine
piece of workmanship."<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<h3>FANTASIA, "FRANCESCA DA RIMINI": Op. 32</h3>

<p>Tschaikowsky visited Paris in the summer of
1876, and while there sketched the plan of a
symphonic poem after Dante&mdash;"Francesca da
Rimini." He had intended to write an opera based
on this theme, and had considered a libretto on
the subject prepared by one Zvantsieff. But the
project was abandoned. In July of that year he
wrote from Paris to his brother Modeste: "Early
this morning I read through the fifth canto of the
'Inferno,' and was beset by the wish to compose
a symphonic poem, 'Francesca da Rimini.' On
October 26th he wrote from Moscow: "I have
just finished a new work, the symphonic fantasia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
'Francesca da Rimini.' I have worked on it <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">con
amore</i>, and I believe that my love has brought
with it success.... However, a just estimate of
this work is impossible so long as it is not orchestrated
and has not been played."</p>

<p>The fantasia was completed in November, 1876.</p>

<p>Prefaced to the score is this introduction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="small2">"Dante arrives in the second circle of hell. He sees
that here the incontinent are punished, and their punishment
is to be tormented continually by the crudest winds
under a gloomy air. Among these tortured ones he recognizes
Francesca da Rimini, who tells her story."</p></blockquote>

<p>Then follows a quotation from the fifth canto of
the "Inferno," beginning with Francesca's words:</p>

<p class="indent small2">
"... <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Nessun maggior dolore,<br />
Che ricordasi del tempo felice<br />
Nella miseria;</i>"</p>

<p class="indent small2">
("... There is no greater pain<br />
Than to recall a happier time<br />
In misery;")</p>

<p>and ending with the concluding line of the canto&mdash;that
is to say, twenty-one lines out of the hundred
and forty comprised in the canto. Since it is, perhaps,
well to recall the entire story as Dante relates
it, in order that the scope and significance of
Tschaikowsky's music may be understood, I quote
the canto from beginning to end, in the extraordinarily
careful and felicitous translation of Dr.
John A. Carlyle:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"Thus I descended from the first circle down to the
second,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> which encompasses less space, and so much greater
pain, that it stings to wailing. There Minos sits horrific,
and grins; examines the crimes upon the entrance;
judges, and sends according as he girds himself. I say
that when the ill-born spirit comes before him it confesses
all; and that sin-discerner sees what place in hell is for it,
and with his tail makes as many circles round himself
as the degrees [the number of grades or circles] he will
have to descend. Always before him stands a crowd of
them. They go each in its turn to judgment; they tell
and hear and then are whirled down.</p>

<p>"'O thou who comest to the abode of pain!' said Minos
to me, leaving the act of that great office when he saw
me; 'look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest.
Let not the wideness of the entrance deceive thee.'</p>

<p>"And my guide to him: 'Why criest thou? Hinder
not his fated going. Thus it is willed there where what
is willed can be done; and ask no more.'</p>

<p>"Now begin the doleful notes to reach me; now am I
come where much lamenting strikes me. I am come into
a part void of all light, which bellows like the sea in tempest
when it is combated by warring winds. The hellish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
storm, which never rests, leads the spirits with its sweep;
whirling and smiting, it vexes them. When they arrive
before the ruin, there the shrieks, the moanings, and the
lamentation; there they blaspheme the divine power.</p>

<p>"I learned that to such torment were doomed the carnal
sinners who subject reason to lust. And as their wings
bear along the starlings, at the cold season, in large and
crowded troop, so that blast, the evil spirits. Hither,
thither, down, up, it leads them. No hope ever comforts
them, not of rest but even of less pain. And as the cranes
go chanting their lays, making a long streak of themselves
in the air, so I saw the shadows come, uttering wails,
borne by that strife of winds. Whereat I said: 'Master,
who are those people whom the black air thus lashes?'</p>

<p>"'The first of these concerning whom thou seekest to
know,' he then replied, 'was Empress of many tongues.
With the vice of luxury she was so broken that she made
lust and law alike in her decree, to take away the blame
she had incurred. She is Semiramis, of whom we read
that she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse. She
held the land which the Soldan rules. That other is she
[Dido] who slew herself in love and broke faith to the
ashes of Sichæus. Next comes luxurious Cleopatra.'</p>

<p>"Helena I saw, for whom so long a time of ill revolved;
and I saw the great Achilles, who fought at last with love.
I saw Paris, Tristan. And more than a thousand shades
he showed to me, and with his finger named them, whom
love had parted from our life. After I had heard my
teacher name the olden dames and cavaliers, pity conquered
me, and I was as if bewildered.</p>

<p>"I began: 'Poet, willingly would I speak with these two
that go together, and seem so light upon the wind.'</p>

<p>"And he to me: 'Thou shalt see when they are nearer to
us; and do thou then entreat them by that love which
leads them, and they will come.'</p>

<p>"Soon as the wind bends them to us I raise my voice:
'O wearied souls! come to speak with us, if none denies it.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"As doves, called by desire, with open and steady wings
fly through the air to their loved nest, borne by their will,
so those spirits issued from the band where Dido is, coming
to us through the malignant air. Such was the force
of my affectuous cry.</p>

<p>[Francesca speaks] "'O living creature, gracious and
benign! that goest through the black air, visiting us who
stained the earth with blood. If the King of the Universe
were our friend, we would pray him for thy peace, seeing
that thou hast pity of our perverse misfortune. Of
that which it pleases thee to hear and to speak, we will
hear and speak with you, whilst the wind, as now, is
silent.</p>

<p>"'The town<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> where I was born sits on the shore where
Po descends to rest with his attendant streams. Love,
which is quickly caught in gentle heart, took him with the
fair body of which I was bereft; and the manner still
afflicts me. Love, which to no loved one permits excuse
from loving, took me so strongly with delight in him
that, as thou seest, even now it leaves me not. Love led
us to one death. Caïna [the place in the lowest circle of
hell occupied by Cain and other fratricides] waits for him
who quenched our life.' These words from them were
offered to us.</p>

<p>"After I had heard those wounded souls, I bowed my
face and held it low until the Poet said to me: 'What art
thou thinking of?'</p>

<p>"When I answered, I began: 'Ah me! what sweet
thoughts, what longing led them to the woful pass!'</p>

<p>"Then I turned again to them; and I spoke, and began:
'Francesca, thy torments make me weep with grief and
pity. But tell me: in the time of the sweet sighs, by what
and how love granted you to know the dubious desires?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"And she to me: 'No greater pain than to recall a happy
time in wretchedness; and this thy teacher knows. But,
if thou hast such desire to learn the first root of our love,
I will do like one who weeps and tells.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a>

constrained him. We were alone and without all suspicion.
Several times that reading urged our eyes to
meet and changed the color of our faces. But one moment
alone it was that overcame us. When we read how
the fond smile was kissed by such a lover, he who shall
never be divided from me kissed my mouth all trembling.

<p>"Whilst the one spirit thus spake, the other wept so,
that I fainted with pity, as if I had been dying; and fell,
as a dead body falls."</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The opening section (<em>Andante lugubre</em>) of Tschaikowsky's
fantasia evokes the sinister and dreadful
scene which greeted Dante and Virgil as they entered
the region of the second circle&mdash;the tempestuous
winds, the wailing of the damned, the appalling
gloom and horror of the place. "Pale,
tormented, shadowy figures approach; they increase
in number; orchestral spasm follow spasm;
and then there is rest, there is awful silence."
There follows a lull in the whirlwind, and a theme
heard at the beginning (horns, cornet, trombones)
"announces solemnly the approach of Francesca
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
and Paolo. The wood-wind takes the theme, and
a recitative leads to the second section of the fantasia,
<em>Andante cantabile non troppo</em>." In this section
the apparition of the two lovers is brought
before us. "This middle part is especially beautiful,"
observes a German annotator, "on account
of the original and vaporous accompaniment by
three flutes of the chief theme. The ... motive
of the first section enters ('cello) as the thought of
remorse, but a delightful melody of the English
horn and delicate harp-chords dispel the gloomy
thoughts; and the picture of the two, happy in their
all-absorbing, passionate, but disastrous love, is
maintained. ["We seem," says Mrs. Rosa Newmarch
of this passage, "to hear the spirit-voice of
Francesca herself, from which all the horrors of
hell have not taken the sweetness of human love
and poignant memory."] Then the "lamenting
ghosts" re-enter (<em>largamente</em>, wind instruments, then
in the strings). "The lovers vanish in an orchestral
storm." Saint-Saëns, in his lively <cite>Portraits
et Souvenirs</cite>, makes some interesting comments on
the music: "The gentlest and kindest of men,"
he writes, "has let loose a whirlwind in this work,
and shows as little pity for his interpreters and
hearers as Satan for sinners [here speaks the invincible
classicist!].... A long, melodic phrase, the
love song of Paolo and Francesca, soars above this
tempest, this <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bufera infernale</i>, which attracted Liszt
before Tschaikowsky, and engendered his Dante
Symphony [see pages 164-173]. Liszt's Francesca
is more touching and more Italian in character than
that of the great Slavonic composer; the whole
work is so typical that we seem to see the profile of
Dante projected in it. Tschaikowsky's art is more
subtle, the outlines clearer, the material more attractive;
from a purely musical point of view the
work is better. Liszt's version is perhaps more to
the taste of the poet or painter. On the whole,
they can fitly stand side by side; either of them is
worthy of Dante."</p>

<h3>SYMPHONY No. 4, IN F MINOR: Op. 36</h3>

<p class="indentm">1. <em>Andante sostenuto</em></p>

<p>Tschaikowsky began this symphony in 1876, and
completed it in the winter of 1877-78. The score
bears the dedication: "To my Best Friend"; and
behind the phrase lies a singular history, too long to
be told here in full. The "best friend" was
Nadeshda Filaretowna von Meck,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> a widow living
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
in Moscow. Exceedingly wealthy, she deeply admired
the music of Tschaikowsky. She inquired
concerning his pecuniary circumstances, and, learning
that his means were straitened and that he
was in debt, she sent him, in the summer of 1877, the
sum of three thousand rubles. A correspondence
had meanwhile begun between them (the first
letter, from Mrs. von Meck, is dated December
30, 1876); she had given Tschaikowsky certain
small commissions to do for her&mdash;transcriptions
for violin and piano of certain of his works which
she wished made&mdash;and for these she paid him
generous fees. In the autumn of 1877 she asked
him, with many apologies, to permit her to settle
upon him an annual allowance of 6000 rubles
(about $3000), that he might compose undisturbed
by material cares. "If I wanted something
from you," she wrote, "of course you would give
it me&mdash;is it not so? Very well, then, we cry quits.
Do not interfere with my management of your
domestic economy, Peter Iljitsch." She desired
and insisted that they should never meet or personally
know each other; "the more you fascinate
me, the more I shrink from knowing you," she
wrote. Tschaikowsky accepted the settlement,
and respected her wish concerning their intercourse.
"I can only serve you," wrote the composer, "by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>means of my music. Nadeshda Filaretowna, every
note which comes from my pen in future is dedicated
to you!" They corresponded frequently, at length,
and with the deepest intellectual and spiritual intimacy;
but they never met. "When they accidentally
came face to face," writes Tschaikowsky's
brother Modeste, "they passed as total strangers.
To the end of their days they never exchanged a
word...."</p>

<p>Their correspondence, which extended over thirteen
years, was abruptly and lamentably ended.
In December, 1890, Tschaikowsky received a letter
from his patroness informing him that she was
on the brink of ruin, and that she would be obliged
to discontinue his allowance; this, despite the fact
that she had more than once declared to him that,
no matter what occurred, his annuity was assured
to him for life. As it happened, this curtailment of
his income did not greatly affect Tschaikowsky's
pecuniary situation, for he had come to know
prosperity with his increasing fame; but he suffered
keen anxiety on his friend's account. Not
long after, it turned out that Mrs. von Meck's
fortune was not seriously affected, after all&mdash;a turn
of events which, however, brought misery to the
hyper-sensitive soul of Tschaikowsky. He persuaded
himself that Mrs. von Meck's announcement
had been merely "an excuse to get rid of him
on the first opportunity"; that he had been mistaken
in idealizing his relations with his "best
friend"; that his allowance had long since ceased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
to be the outcome of a generous impulse. "Such
were my relations with her," he wrote at this time
to a friend, "that I never felt oppressed by her
generous gifts; but now they weigh upon me in
retrospect. My pride is hurt; my faith in her
unfailing readiness to help me, and to make any
sacrifice for my sake, is betrayed." He thought
of returning to her in full the money she had settled
upon him, but feared to mortify her. He endeavored,
both frankly and diplomatically, to renew
their intercourse; but to no avail. She made
no response whatever to his attempts to continue
their relationship, either through letters or
in response to overtures made by Tschaikowsky
through mutual friends. He learned that she was
ill&mdash;ill of "a terrible nervous disease, which changed
her relations not only to him, but to others." Yet
no illness, no misfortune, it seemed to him, could,
as he wrote, "change the sentiments which were expressed
in [her] letters."... "I would sooner,"
he declared, "have believed that the earth could
fail beneath me than that our relations could suffer
change. But the inconceivable has happened, and
all my ideas of human nature, all my faith in the
best of mankind, have been turned upside-down.
My peace is broken, and the share of happiness fate
has allotted me is embittered and spoiled." Two
years later, on his death-bed, her name was constantly
and feverishly on his lips, "in an indignant
or reproachful tone," says Modeste. "... In the
broken phrases of his last delirium these words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
alone were intelligible to those around him."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
Nadeshda von Meck survived him by only two
months. She died January 25, 1894.</p>

<p>The Fourth Symphony is closely bound up with
this singular experience. Not only is it dedicated
to Tschaikowsky's devoted benefactress, but he
speaks of it repeatedly in his correspondence with
her as "our" symphony. "May this music, which
is so intimately associated with the thought of
you," he wrote to her in November, 1877, "speak
to you and tell you that I love you with all my
heart and soul. O my best and incomparable
friend!" That the symphony has a well-defined
programme we know on the authority of the composer
himself, though the score bears no descriptive
title or prefatory note of any kind. Writing
to Mrs. von Meck from Florence in March,
1878, Tschaikowsky sent this exposition of his music,
which he accompanied with thematic illustrations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"You ask if in composing this symphony I had a
special programme in view.... For <em>our</em> symphony
there is a programme. That is to say, it is possible
to express its contents in words, and I will
tell you, and you alone, the meaning of the entire
work and of its separate movements. Naturally,
I can do so only as regards its general
features."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>
<p class="center3">[I. <em>Andante sostenuto; Moderato con anima in movimento
di valse</em>]</p>

<p>"The Introduction is the kernel, the quintessence,
the chief thought of the whole symphony. [Tschaikowsky
quotes the stern and threatening opening
theme, announced by horns and bassoons, <em>Andante</em>.]
This is Fate, the fatal power which hinders one in
the pursuit of happiness from gaining the goal,
which jealously provides that peace and comfort
do not prevail, that the sky is not free from clouds&mdash;a
might that swings, like the sword of Damocles,
constantly over the head, that poisons continually
the soul. This might is overpowering and invincible.
There is nothing to do but to submit and
vainly to complain. [Tschaikowsky quotes here the
expressive theme for strings, <em>Moderato con anima</em>.]
The feeling of despondency and despair grows ever
stronger and more passionate. It is better to turn
from the realities and to lull one's self in dreams.
[Clarinet solo, accompanied by strings.] O joy!
What a lovely and gentle dream! A radiant being,
promising happiness, floats before me and beckons
me on. The importunate first theme of the allegro
is now heard afar off, and now the soul is wholly
enwrapped with dreams. There is no thought of
gloom and cheerlessness. Happiness! Happiness!
Happiness!... No, they are only dreams, and Fate
dispels them. The whole of life is only a constant
alternation between dismal reality and flattering
dreams of happiness. There is no port: you will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
tossed hither and thither by the waves, until the
sea swallows you. This, approximately, is the programme
of the first movement."</p>

<p class="center3">[II. <em>Andantino, in modo di canzona</em>]</p>

<p>"The second movement shows suffering in another
stage. It is a feeling of melancholy such as
fills one when one sits alone at home, exhausted by
work; the book has slipped out of one's hand; a
swarm of memories arise in one's mind. How sad
that so much has been and is gone, and yet it is
pleasant to think of the days of one's youth. We
regret the past and have neither the courage nor
the desire to begin a new life. We are weary of life.
We wish refreshment, retrospection. We think of
happy hours when our young blood still sparkled
and effervesced and life brought satisfaction. We
think of moments of sadness and irrepressible losses.
But these things are far away, so far away! It is
sad, yet sweet, to pore over the past."</p>

<p class="center3">[III. <em>Scherzo, "Pizzicato ostinato": Allegro</em>]</p>

<p>"No definite feelings find expression in the third
movement. These are capricious arabesques, intangible
figures which flit through the fancy as if
one had drunk wine and become slightly intoxicated.
The mood is neither merry nor sad. We think of
nothing, but give free rein to the fancy which
humors itself in drafting the most singular lines.
Suddenly there arises the memory of a drunken
peasant and a ribald song.... Military music passes
by in the distance. Such are the disconnected images
which flit through the brain as one sinks into
slumber. They have nothing to do with reality;
they are incomprehensible, bizarre, fragmentary."</p>

<p class="center3">[IV. <em>Finale: Allegro con fuoco</em>]</p>

<p>"Fourth movement. If you find no pleasure in
yourself, look about you. Go to the folk. See
how it understands to be jolly, how it surrenders
itself to gaiety. The picture of a folk-holiday.
Scarcely have you forgotten yourself, scarcely have
you had time to be absorbed in the happiness of
others, before untiring Fate again announces its
approach. The other children of men are not concerned
with you. They neither see nor feel that you
are lonely and sad. How they enjoy themselves,
how happy they are! And will you maintain that
everything in the world is sad and gloomy? There
is still happiness&mdash;simple, native happiness. Rejoice
in the happiness of others&mdash;and you can still live.</p>

<p>"This is all that I can tell you, my dear friend,
about the symphony...."</p>

in order of composition and opus number,
it would stand between the Fourth (Op. 36, 1876-78)

the following preface, printed in French and
Russian:</p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>

<p>"I. Manfred wanders in the Alps. Tortured by the
fatal anguish of doubt, racked by remorse and despair, his
soul is a prey to sufferings without a name. Neither the
occult science, whose mysteries he has probed to the
bottom, and by means of which the gloomy powers of hell
are subject to him, nor anything in the world can give him
the forgetfulness to which alone he aspires. The memory
of the fair Astarte, whom he has loved and lost, eats his
heart. Nothing can dispel the curse which weighs on
Manfred's soul; and without cessation, without truce, he
is abandoned to the tortures of the most atrocious
despair.</p>

<p>"II. The Fairy of the Alps appears to Manfred beneath
the rainbow of the waterfall.</p>

<p>"III. Pastorale. Simple, free, and peaceful life of the
mountaineers.</p>

<p>"IV. The underground palace of Arimanes. Manfred
appears in the midst of a bacchanal. Invocation of the
ghost of Astarte. She foretells him the end of his earthly
woes. Manfred's death."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>Manfred's despair and anguish, his inextinguishable

longing and remorse, his fruitless quest after

heard at the beginning&mdash;a sombre and tragic motive
for bassoons and bass clarinet. There are
also musical symbols for his passionate appeal for
oblivion, for his occult powers, and for the thought
of Astarte. "The movement should not be considered
as panoramic in any sense. There is no
attempt to depict any special scene, to translate
into music any particular soliloquy. It is the soul
of Manfred that the composer wishes to portray."</p>

<p class="center3">II<br />
(<em>Scherzo: Vivace con spirito</em>)</p>

<p>This movement was suggested by the second
scene of act two of Byron's drama, in which Manfred,
beside the cataract, evokes the Witch of the
Alps, tells her of Astarte and of his own remorse
and longing, and&mdash;although she intimates that she
may help him&mdash;rejects her aid; for he is not willing
to swear obedience to her will. "As the scene in
the poem may be regarded as a picturesque episode&mdash;for
the incantation is fruitless and only one of
many&mdash;so the music is a relief after the tumultuous
passion and raging despair of the first movement.
The vision of the dashing, glistening cataract continues
until, with note of triangle and chord of harp,
the rainbow is revealed." To the accompaniment
of mysterious and ethereal harp tones Manfred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
conjures up the witch, "who rises beneath the arch
of the sunbow of the torrent." Her song is suggested
(violins and harps). There is a poignant
reminiscence of Manfred's despair. "The glory of
the cataract is once more seen. It pales as the
theme of despair is heard again."</p>

<p class="center3">III<br />
(<em>Pastorale: Andante con moto</em>)</p>

<p>This scene is general in its suggestiveness; it has
no definite connection with any particular scene
in Byron's poem. The opening is idyllic, but the
mood of the music is soon altered. Again we are
reminded of Manfred's unalterable woe. Perhaps
Tschaikowsky had in mind here a tense passage
in the scene between Manfred and the Chamois-Hunter
(Act II., Scene I.):</p>

<p class="indentm small2">
<small>"MANFRED.</small> Think'st thou existence doth depend on time?<br />
It doth; but actions are our epochs: mine<br />
Have made my days and nights imperishable,<br />
Endless, and all alike, as sands on the shore,<br />
Innumerable atoms; and one desert,<br />
Barren and cold, on which the wild waves break,<br />

<p class="indent6 small2">"This do I see&mdash;and then I look within&mdash;<br />
It matters not&mdash;my soul was scorch'd already!"</p>

<p class="center3">IV<br />
(<em>Finale: Allegro con fuoco</em>)</p>

<p>This bacchanal in the underground palace of
Arimanes is Tschaikowsky's own invention; there
is no bacchanal, or suggestion of one, in the corresponding
scene in Byron's poem, where Arimanes,
seated on his throne of fire, is surrounded by
spirits, who praise him in a worshipful hymn.</p>

<p>At the climax of the music's wild revelling the
motive of despair is recalled; the music becomes
uncanny, mysterious; we hear the theme of Manfred.
Nemesis, who has entered the hall together
with the Destinies, invokes the wraith of Astarte:</p>

<p class="indent6 small2">
<small>"MANFRED.</small> Can this be death? there's bloom upon her cheek;<br />
But now I see it is no living hue,<br />

<p>The music rises to a momentous and tragic climax.

<li><em>Allegro con grazia</em></li>
<li><em>Allegro, molto vivace</em></li>
<li><em>Finale: Adagio lamentoso</em></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>Tschaikowsky wrote to Vladimir Davidoff on
February 23, 1893:</p>

<p>"Just as I was starting on my journey [the visit
to Paris in December, 1892] the idea came to me
for a new symphony. This time with a programme;
but a programme which should be a riddle to all&mdash;let
them guess it who can! The work will be entitled
'A Programme Symphony' (No. 6). This
programme is penetrated by subjective sentiment.
During my journey, while composing it in my mind,
I have often wept bitterly. Now that I am home
again I have settled down to sketch out the work,
and I work at it with such ardor that in less than
four days I have finished the first movement, while
the other movements are clearly outlined in my
mind. There will be much, as regards the form,
that will be novel in this work. For instance, the
Finale will not be a boisterous Allegro, but, on the
contrary, an extended Adagio." Six months later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
he wrote to Davidoff that the symphony was progressing,
and that he considered it the best&mdash;especially
"the most open-hearted"&mdash;of all his
works. "I love it as I have never loved any of
my musical offspring before." On August 24th he
informed his publisher, Jurgenson, that he had
finished orchestrating the symphony; nor did his
opinion of it change. "It is indescribably beautiful,"
he wrote, in a fervor of enthusiasm, to his
brother Modeste; and to the Grand-Duke Constantine
he wrote, on October 3d: "Without exaggeration
I have put my whole soul into this work."
It was the last score but one upon which he was to
work. Five weeks later he was dead.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The symphony was produced at St. Petersburg
on October 28th, when it made little impression;
it was said that its inspiration "stood far below
Tschaikowsky's other symphonies." It did not
then bear the title "Pathetic." How it came to
be so named is thus related by Modeste Tschaikowsky:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The morning after the concert I found my
brother sitting at the breakfast-table with the score
of the symphony before him. He had agreed to
send the score to Jurgenson [his publisher] that
very day, but could not decide upon a title. He
did not care to designate it merely by a number, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
he had abandoned his original intention of entitling
it 'A Programme Symphony.' 'What would
<em>Programme Symphony</em> mean,' he said, 'if I will
not give the programme?' I suggested 'Tragic'
Symphony as an appropriate title, but that did not
please him. I left the room while he was still
undecided. Suddenly 'Pathetic' occurred to me,
and I went back to the room and suggested it. I
remember, as though it were yesterday, how he
exclaimed: 'Bravo, Modi, splendid! <em>Pathetic!</em>'
And then and there he added to the score, in my
presence, the title that will always remain."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What, precisely, was in Tschaikowsky's mind
when he composed this "Programme Symphony"?
According to Tschaikowsky's intimate friend Nicholas
Kashkin, "if the composer had disclosed it
to the public, the world would not have regarded
the symphony as a kind of legacy from one filled
with a presentiment of his own approaching end."
To him it seems more reasonable "to interpret the
overwhelming energy of the third movement and
the abysmal sorrow of the Finale in the broader
light of a national or historical significance, rather
than to narrow them to the expression of an individual
experience. If the last movement is intended
to be predictive, it is surely of things vaster
and issues more fatal than are contained in a mere
personal apprehension of death. It speaks rather
of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lamentation large et souffrance inconnue</i>, and
seems to set the seal of finality on all human hopes.
Even if we eliminate the purely subjective interest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
this autumnal inspiration of Tschaikowsky, in
which we hear 'the ground whirl of the perished
leaves of hope,' still remains the most profoundly
stirring of his works."</p>

<p>No one has speculated with finer tact and sympathy
concerning this extraordinary human document
than has Mr. Philip Hale, whose meditations
may well serve as a comment upon the character
of the music:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Each hearer has his own thoughts when he
is 'reminded by the instruments.' To some this
symphony is as the life of man. The story is to
them of man's illusions, desires, loves, struggles,
victories, and end. In the first movement they
find, with the despair of old age and the dread
of death, the recollection of early years, with
the transports and illusions of love, the remembrance
of youth and all that is contained in that
word.</p>

<p>"The second movement might bear as a motto
the words of the Third Kalandar in the <cite>Thousand
Nights and a Night</cite>: 'And we sat down to drink,
and some sang songs and others played the lute
and psaltery and recorders and other instruments,
and the bowl went merrily round. Hereupon such
gladness possessed me that I forgot the sorrows of
the world one and all, and said: "This is indeed life
O sad that 'tis fleeting!'" The trio<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> is as the sound
of the clock that in Poe's wild tale compelled even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
the musicians of the orchestra to pause momentarily
in their performance, to hearken to the sound;
'and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions,
and there was a brief disconcert of the whole
gay company; and, while the chimes of the clock yet
rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew pale,
and the more aged and sedate passed their hands
over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation.'
In this trio Death beats the drum. With
Tschaikowsky, here, as in the 'Manfred' symphony,
the drum is the most tragic of instruments. The
persistent drum-beat in this trio is poignant in
despair not untouched with irony. Man says:
'Come now, I'll be gay'; and he tries to sing and to
dance and to forget. His very gaiety is labored,
forced, constrained, in an unnatural rhythm. And
then the drum is heard, and there is wailing, there
is angry protest, there is the conviction that the
struggle against Fate is vain. Again there is the
deliberate effort to be gay, but the drum once heard
beats in the ears forever.</p>

<p>"The third movement&mdash;the march-scherzo&mdash;is the
excuse, the pretext, for the final lamentation. The
man triumphs; he knows all that there is in earthly
fame. Success is hideous, as Victor Hugo said.
The blare of trumpets, the shouts of the mob, may
drown the sneers of envy; but at Pompey passing
Roman streets, at Tasso with the laurel wreath, at
coronation of czar or inauguration of president,
Death grins, for he knows the emptiness, the vulgarity,
of what this world calls success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"This battle-drunk, delirious movement must perforce
precede the mighty wail&mdash;</p>

<div class="indent">

<div class="indentb">"'The glories of our blood and state</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Are shadows, not substantial things;</div>
<div class="indentb">There is no armor against fate;</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Death lays his icy hands on kings.'"</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>The last movement&mdash;the prodigious <em>Adagio lamentoso</em>&mdash;moved
Mr. Vernon Blackburn to a comparison
with Shelley's "Adonais": "The precise
emotions," he wrote, "down to a certain and extreme
point, which inspired Shelley in his wonderful
expression of grief and despair, also inspired
the greatest of modern musicians since Wagner
in his 'Swan Song'&mdash;his last musical utterance on
earth. The first movement is the exact counterpart
of those lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent small2">
"'He will awake no more, oh, never more!&mdash;<br />
Within the twilight chamber spreads apace<br />
The shadow of white Death....'</p>

<p>"As the musician strays into the darkness and
into the miserable oblivion of death, ... Tschaikowsky
reaches the full despair of those other
lines&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent small2 ileft8">
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">"'We decay</span><br />
Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief<br />
Convulse us and consume us day by day,<br />
And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.'</p>

<p>"With that mysterious and desperate hopelessness
the Russian comes to an end of his faith and anticipation....
For as ['life'], writes Shelley, 'like
a many-colored dome of glass, stains the white radiance
of eternity,' even so Tschaikowsky in this
symphony has stained eternity's radiance: he has
captured the years and bound them into a momentary
emotional pang."</p>

<h3>"THE VOYVODE,"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> ORCHESTRAL BALLAD (Posthumous):
Op. 78</h3>

<p>Tschaikowsky composed <cite>Le Voyvode</cite> at Tiflis in
1890, under the inspiration of a poem by the Polish
poet Adam Mickiewicz (1798-1855). It is said
that after the first performance of the work at
Moscow in November, 1891, Tschaikowsky, disheartened
over the cool reception of his music
by the audience, and by the adverse criticism of
his friends, "tore his score in pieces, exclaiming,
'Such rubbish should never have been written!'"<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
The orchestral parts are alleged to have been preserved,
and the score restored from them. At all
events, the work was published in 1897, four years
after Tschaikowsky's death.</p>

<p>Mickiewicz's poem, in French and Russian, prefaces
the score. It has been translated into English
prose as follows:<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<div class="small2">
<blockquote>
<p>"The voyvode comes back from the war late at night.
He orders silence, rushes toward the nuptial bed, draws
aside the curtains. 'Tis, then, true! No one; the bed is
empty.</p>

<p>"Darker than black night, he lowers his eyes shot with
rage, twists his grizzling mustache; then, throwing back
his long sleeves, he leaves, and bolts the door. 'Hallo,
there,' he cries, 'Devil's food!'</p>

<p>"'Why do I not see at the gate bolts or watch dogs?
Race of Ham! Quick, my gun; bring a sack, a cord, and
take the carbine hanging on the wall. Follow me. I shall
make known my vengeance on this woman!'</p>

<p>"The master and the young servant spy along the wall.
They go into the garden and see through the bushes the
young woman, all in white, seated near the fountain with
a young man at her feet.</p>

<p>"He was saying: 'And so nothing is left to me of those
former delights, of that which I so dearly loved! The
sighs of your white breast, the pressure of your soft hand&mdash;these
the voyvode has bought!</p>

<p>"'How many years did I sigh after you, how many
years did I seek you, and you have renounced me! The
voyvode did not seek you, he did not sigh for you&mdash;he
made his money jingle and you gave yourself to him!</p>

<p>"'I have passed through the darkness of the night to
see the eyes of my well-beloved, to press her soft hand, to
wish her in her new dwelling many prosperous years,
much joy, and then to leave her forever.'...</p>

<p>"The fair one wept and mourned; the young man embraced
her knees; and the other two watched them through
the bushes. They laid their guns on the ground; they
took cartridges from their belts; they bit them and
rammed them home.</p>

<p>"Then they crept up gently. 'Master, I cannot aim,'
said the poor servant; 'is it the wind? But there are tears
in my eyes&mdash;I tremble&mdash;my arms are growing weak; there
is no priming powder in the pan'&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
"'Be silent, slave; I'll teach you to whimper! Fill the
pan&mdash;now aim&mdash;aim at the forehead of the false woman&mdash;more
to the left&mdash;higher&mdash;I'll take care of the lover&mdash;hush&mdash;my
turn first&mdash;wait!'</p>

<p>"The carbine-shot rang through the garden. The
young servant could not wait. The voyvode screamed;
the voyvode staggered. The servant's aim, it seems, was
poor: the ball pierced the voyvode's forehead."</p>

by Dante in the fifth canto:</p>

<p>"The Second Circle, or proper commencement of Hell; and
Minos, the Infernal Judge, at its entrance. It contains the
Souls of Carnal Sinners; and their punishment consists in being
driven about incessantly, in total darkness, by fierce winds.
First among them comes Semiramis, the Babylonian queen.
Dido, Cleopatra, Helena, Achilles, Paris, and a great multitude
of others pass in succession. Dante is overcome and bewildered
with pity at the sight of them, when his attention is
suddenly attracted to two spirits that keep together and seem
strangely light upon the wind. He is unable to speak for some
time, after finding that it is Francesca da Rimini, with her
lover Paolo; and falls to the ground, as if dead, after he has
heard their painful story."</p>

lord of Ravenna. She was given in marriage to Giovanni (or
Gianciotto) Malatesta, the eldest son of Malatesta Vecchio,
tyrant of Rimini. Giovanni was called "<em>Lo Sciancato</em>"&mdash;"the
lame," or "hipshot." Not only was he a cripple, but he
was much older than Francesca, and of stern and forbidding
temper. Some say that he secured Francesca for wife by
trickery, she being led to suppose that Paolo ("<em>Il Bello</em>"), the
young brother of Giovanni, "a handsome man, very pleasant
and of courteous breeding," was her future husband; that she
therefore permitted herself to love him, and did not learn of
the deception until "the morning ensuing the marriage." Giovanni
surprised his wife and his brother together, and killed
them both&mdash;between the years 1287 and 1289, says Hieronymus
Rubeus in the first edition of his <cite>Hist. Ravennat.</cite> (Venice, 1572);
in a later edition (1603) the date is given as early in 1289. The
lovers were buried in the same grave. Guido Novello, with
whom Dante lived at Ravenna, was the son of Francesca's

<h2>WAGNER</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Richard Wagner: born in Leipsic, May 22, 1813; died in Venice,
February 13, 1883</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"A 'FAUST' OVERTURE"<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></h3>

<p>Wagner, during his sojourn in Paris in 1840,
wrote an orchestral piece which, as he relates,
he called an "overture to Goethe's 'Faust,' but
which was in reality intended for the first section
of a grand 'Faust' symphony." The curious and
interesting history of this work may best be told
in excerpts from Wagner's correspondence with his
devoted friend and benefactor, Franz Liszt. Liszt,
to whom Wagner had sent the manuscript of the
overture in 1848, wrote in 1852 (October 7th),
some months after he had produced the overture
at Weimar:<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>"The work is quite worthy of you; but, if you
will allow me to make a remark, I must confess
that I should like either a second middle part or else
a quieter and more agreeably colored treatment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
the present middle part. The brass is a little too
massive there, and&mdash;forgive my opinion&mdash;the motive
in F is not satisfactory: it wants grace in a certain
sense, and is a kind of hybrid thing, neither
fish nor flesh, which stands in no proper relation of
contrast to what has gone before and what follows,
and in consequence impedes the interest. If instead
of this you introduced a soft, tender, melodious
part, modulated <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">à la</i> Gretchen, I think I can
assure you that your work would gain very much.
Think this over, and do not be angry in case I have
said something stupid."</p>

<p>To this Wagner responded (November 9, 1852):
"You beautifully spotted the lie when I tried to
make myself believe that I had written an overture
to 'Faust.' You have felt quite justly what
is wanting: the woman is wanting. Perhaps you
would at once understand my tone-poem if I called
it 'Faust in Solitude.' At that time I intended to
write an entire 'Faust' symphony. The first movement,
that which is ready, was this 'Solitary Faust,'
longing, despairing, cursing. The 'feminine' floats
around him as an object of his longing, but not in
its divine reality; and it is just this insufficient image
of his longing which he destroys in his despair.
The second movement was to introduce Gretchen,
the woman. I had a theme for her, but it was only
a theme. The whole remains unfinished. I wrote
my 'Flying Dutchman' instead. This is the whole
explanation. If now, from a last remnant of weakness
and vanity, I hesitate to abandon this 'Faust'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
work altogether, I shall certainly have to remodel it,
but only as regards instrumental modulation. The
theme which you desire I cannot introduce. This
would naturally involve an entirely new composition,
for which I have no inclination. If I publish
it, I shall give it its proper title, 'Faust in Solitude,'
or 'The Solitary Faust: a Tone-Poem for
Orchestra.'"</p>

<p>He did not "abandon" it. Writing to Liszt from
Zurich in January, 1855, he congratulated him on
the completion of his "Faust" symphony, and
added: "It is an absurd coincidence that just at
this time I have been taken with a desire to remodel
my old 'Faust' overture. I have made an entirely
new score, have rewritten the instrumentation
throughout, have made many changes, and have
given more expansion and importance to the middle
portion (second motive). I shall give it in a few
days at a concert here, under the title of 'A "Faust"
Overture.' The motto will be:</p>

<div class="indent small2">
<div class="indentb">"'Der Gott, der mir im Busen wohnt,</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Kann tief mein Innerstes erregen;</div>
<div class="indentb">Der über allen meinen Kräften thront,</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Er kann nach aussen nichts bewegen;</div>
<div class="indentb">Und so ist mir das Dasein eine Last,</div>
<div class="indentb">Der Tod erwünscht, das Leben mir verhasst!'</div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;but I shall not publish it in any case."</p>

<p>This motto, which Wagner retained, has been
translated as follows:<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<div class="indent small2">
<div class="indentb">"The God who dwells within my soul</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Can heave its depths at any hour;</div>
<div class="indentb">Who holds o'er all my faculties control</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Has o'er the outer world no power.</div>
<div class="indentb">Existence lies a load upon my breast,</div>
<div class="indentb">Life is a curse, and death a longed-for rest."</div>
</div>

<p>The overture, in its revised form, was produced
in Zurich, January 23, 1855, at a concert of the
<em>Allgemeine Musikgesellschaft</em>. Two days later, Liszt
wrote to the composer: "You were quite right in
arranging a new score of your overture. If you
have succeeded in making the middle part a little
more pliable, this work, significant as it was
before, must have gained considerably. Be kind
enough to have a copy made, and send it me <em>as
soon as possible</em>. There will probably be some
orchestral concerts here, and I should like to give
this overture at the end of February."</p>

<p>Wagner sent the score, with a letter in which he
said: "Herewith, dearest Franz, you receive my
remodelled 'Faust' overture, which will appear very
insignificant to you by the side of your 'Faust'
symphony. To me the composition is interesting
only on account of the time from which it dates;
this reconstruction has again endeared it to me;
and, with regard to the latter, I am childish enough
to ask you to compare it very carefully with the
first version, because I should like you to take
cognizance of the effect of my experience and of the
more refined feeling I have gained. In my opinion,
new versions of this kind show most distinctly the
spirit in which one has learned to work and the
coarsenesses which one has cast off. You will be
better pleased with the middle part. I was, of
course, unable to introduce a new motive, because
that would have involved a remodelling of almost
the whole work; all I was able to do was to develop
the sentiment a little more broadly, in the form of
a kind of enlarged cadence. Gretchen, of course,
could not be introduced, only Faust himself."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<h3>"A SIEGFRIED IDYL"<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></h3>

<p>In the summer of 1870 (August 25th) Wagner
was married at Lucerne, Switzerland, to Cosima,
daughter of Franz Liszt and the Comtesse d'Agoult,
and the divorced wife of Hans von Bülow.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Siegfried
Wagner, the son of Richard and Cosima, was
born at Triebschen, near Lucerne, June 6, 1869.
In a letter dated June 25, 1870, two months before
his marriage to Cosima, Wagner wrote to a friend:
"She [Cosima] has defied every disapprobation and
taken upon herself every condemnation. She has
borne to me a wonderfully beautiful and vigorous
boy, whom I could boldly call 'Siegfried': he is now
growing, together with my work, and gives me a
new, long life [Wagner was then fifty-seven years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
old], which at last has attained a meaning. Thus
we get along without the world, from which we have
retired entirely.... But now listen; you will, I
trust, approve of the sentiment which leads us to
postpone our visit until I can introduce to you the
mother of my son as my wedded wife."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Cosima, according to Lina Ramann, was born
(in Bellagio) "at Christmas," 1837. The "Siegfried
Idyl" was written by Wagner as a birthday
gift to his wife, and it was first performed December
24, 1871, as an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aubade</i>, on the steps of Wagner's
villa at Triebschen; the orchestra was a small
group of players gathered from the neighborhood.
Hans Richter played the trumpet, and Wagner
himself conducted.</p>

<p>The themes out of which the "Idyl" is evolved
are, with a single exception, motives from the
<cite>Nibelungen</cite> music-drama "Siegfried,"<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> upon which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
Wagner was engaged when his son was born; the
exception is a German cradle-song, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schlaf, Kindchen,
balde, Vöglein flieg'n im Walde</i>.</p>

<p>Wagner dedicated the work to his wife in verses
which have been translated as follows:</p>

<div class="indent small2">
<div class="indentb">"Thy sacrifices have shed blessings o'er me,</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">And to my work have given noble aim,</div>
<div class="indentb">And in the hour of conflict have upbore me,</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Until my labor reached a sturdy frame.</div>
<div class="indentb">Oft in the land of legends we were dreaming&mdash;</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Those legends which contain the Teuton's fame,</div>
<div class="indentb">Until a son upon our lives was beaming,</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Siegfried must be our youthful hero's name.</div>
</div>

<div class="indent small2">
<div class="indentb">"For him and thee I now in tones am praising;</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">What thanks for deeds of love could better be?</div>
<div class="indentb">Within our souls the grateful song upraising</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Which in this music I have now set free.</div>
<div class="indentb">And in this cadence I have held, united,</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">Siegfried, our dearly cherished son, and thee.</div>
<div class="indentb">Thus all the harmonies I now am bringing</div>
<div class="indentb ileft1">But speak the thought which in my heart is ringing."</div>

<h2>WOLF</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>Hugo Wolf: born in Windischgräz, Steiermark, Austria, March
13, 1860; died in Vienna, February 22, 1903</em>)</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">"PENTHESILEA," SYMPHONIC POEM<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></h3>

<p>This symphonic poem is based on the tragedy
of like name by Heinrich von Kleist.<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> The
action of Von Kleist's drama is, in outline, as
follows: The Amazons, under the leadership of
their queen, Penthesilea, go forth to attack the
Greeks besieging Troy, hoping that they may celebrate
at Themiscyra, with the young men whom
they shall capture, the Feast of Roses. The law
of the Amazons requires that only those whom they
have overcome in conquest may celebrate with
them at the festival; therefore, when Penthesilea
encounters in battle the surpassingly beautiful
Achilles, she perforce attacks him, for she is ravished
by love of him. He bests her in the fight,
but she is rescued by her sister warriors. Achilles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
learns that, should he permit her to overcome
him, he might possess her. He plans to engage
her single-handed, and allow her to conquer him.
Penthesilea's suspicions are aroused; she becomes
convinced of his trickery. Her consuming love
is transformed into consuming and vengeful hate.
She slays him, and, together with her hounds, rends
his flesh and exults lustfully in his blood. When
her frenzy&mdash;which is as the frenzy of Wilde's
"Salome"&mdash;is at last appeased, she stabs herself
and sinks upon the body of her lover.</p>

<p>Dr. Kuno Francke finds in the figure of the Amazon
queen an image of Kleist's own soul&mdash;"a soul,"
he writes in his <cite>History of German Literature</cite>, "inspired
with titanic daring, driven by superhuman
desire, bent on conquering Eternity. When the
conviction first dawned upon Kleist that the whole
of truth is beyond human reach, all life henceforth
seemed worthless to him. When Penthesilea, instead
of vanquishing the beloved hero, is overcome
by him, even his love is hateful to her. The ideal
which she cannot fully and without reserve make
hers she must destroy. The god in her having been
killed, the beast awakes. And thus, immediately
after that enchanting scene where the lovers, for
the first time and the last, have been revelling in
mutual surrender and delight, she falls like a tigress
upon the unsuspecting and weaponless man; with
the voluptuousness of despair, she sends the arrow
through his breast; she lets the hounds loose upon
him as he dies, and together with the hounds she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
tears his limbs and drinks his blood, until, at last,
brought back to her senses, and realizing what she
has done, she sinks into the arms of death&mdash;a
character so atrocious and so ravishing, so monstrous
and so divine, so miraculous and so true,
as no other poet ever has created."</p>

<p>Although Wolf's symphonic poem is not provided
with a programme, there are in the score explanatory
titles for its main (connected) divisions. These
titles have been annotated in German as follows
(the translation is that published in the programme
books of the Chicago Orchestra in April, 1904, at
the time of the first American performance of the
work):<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center3">"I<br />
<small>"THE DEPARTURE OF THE AMAZONS FOR TROY</small></p>

<p>"Amid great tumult the fierce warriors prepare to set
out on their campaign, Penthesilea in command&mdash;as is
symbolized by her personal motive, which will be heard
above the clashing of weapons and the shrieking of war-cries.
In exultation the army assembles, the queen dashing
to the front to lead in the march, which begins with
a flourish of trumpets. A contrasting intermediary section
leads to a resumption of the march movement, the
latter dying away as the Amazons, having reached their
destination, go into night encampment&mdash;as represented
by the subdued rolls of the kettle-drums, with which the
movement concludes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p class="center3">"II<br />
<small>"PENTHESILEA'S DREAM OF THE FEAST OF ROSES</small></p>

<p>"As she slumbers, Penthesilea's dreams carry her beyond
the battle impending to the prize which awaits her
after the victory. Over mysterious arpeggios in the violas,
the flutes, oboes, and violins begin a melody in which one
recognizes Penthesilea, transformed into a gentle, loving
woman. The dream-picture becomes more and more
vivid, until all of a sudden the sleeper awakens.</p>

<p class="center3">"III<br />
<small>"COMBATS, PASSIONS, FRENZY, ANNIHILATION</small></p>

<p>"Once aroused, Penthesilea is the ferocious warrior
again; challenged by the foe, she rides forth to battle.
But straightway a conflict of the emotions is suggested by
the interweaving of two motives&mdash;one being mentioned as
denoting Penthesilea's determination to conquer, and the
other as expressive of the yearnings of her heart; their
combined development&mdash;descriptive of their struggle for
supremacy&mdash;mounting presently to a full-orchestra climax,
from which the motive of 'yearning' emerges in certain
wood-wind instruments over a subdued tremolo of the
violas. But the desire for conquest soon gains the upper
hand again, leading to a dramatic climax which brings
to notice the motive of annihilation in the trombones&mdash;opposed
by the violins and wood-wind with a distorted
version of the Penthesilea motive. The tumult subsides
through a picturesque <em>diminuendo</em>, beautified by an expressive
viola solo and leading to the reappearance of
Penthesilea, now tranquillized and gentle. But this mood
does not last long; the orchestra, passing from animation
to agitation, shortly setting up a great shriek of anguish;
following which a chromatic flourish leads to a repetition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>of 'The Departure of the Amazons.' But now Penthesilea
goes not forth to any common struggle, nor does
any dream of happiness beckon her from beyond the victory.
Revenge and destruction are now her only purpose.
With redoubled ferocity the situation mounts to its tragic
climax, which culminates in a frightful screech. Then a
pause; her anger spent, the unhappy queen appears once
more, her face no longer disfigured with passion, but glowing
with yearning and love. Thus, in ecstasy and anguish,
her young life goes out in a sigh."</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
